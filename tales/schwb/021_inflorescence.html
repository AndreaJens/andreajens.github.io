    <p><em>May 2067. It's dead of night. Lejl is at the flower shop where she works, questioned by the cops. Something bad has happened, bad enough to cause two investigators from Yard to get there as quickly as possible.</em></p>
  </div>
</div>
<hr>
<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Once more, from the beginning, please. This time with all the details.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I look up at the person in front of me, the person who listened to a summary of my story, of my recounting of the events, up to the point where I’ve opened the door. Her voice is kind of rough, as if she had recovered from a bad throat condition. Feels like listening to a chainsmoker, even if she didn’t look the part. The scars on her neck and face told a different story – I wonder which one, though. Her hair too, that long, azure hair that is almost touching the ground. It cannot be dyed, it would be insane to keep it in such a beautiful shape and color on a regular basis, unless she used a bottle of hair dye every day or something. No, it <em>has</em> to be natural, whatever means or pact with the devil she made to have it look that way. She looks positively gorgeous, I’m not going to lie about it. Her emerald eyes are literally piercing through mine, staring deep inside my soul, and those strange scars on her skin make her somehow even more attractive. Yet, I must restrain myself. She’s here to do her job. She’s a sleuth from Yard.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I’d... rather not to, detective Rainer. It was... already quite painful.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Kramers, the shop’s mascot, is placidly sitting near me, rubbing his back against the chair. Our little pet nocti, still recovering from that horrible parasite plant infection. That Paddy was a godsent, I must ask Chai for her number again, I owe her at least a drink. Li’l Kramers seems to feel way better already, but I’m sure he’s still aching here and there. I notice how detective Rainer stares at him, with some sort of curiosity, mixed with disgust. I can’t fathom the reason why, but contrary to most people I know, she behaves as if she had one or more close encounters with phages – and that they weren’t pleasant at all.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“How did you get to know this Niamm Kissilmer?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Oh, huh. That’s the question? I don’t think I can answer truthfully, I’m sorry. Can’t tell you Niamm Kissilmer saved me from the Shadow Gallery and hired me for his newly opened flower shop in New Langdon. I can’t reveal my origins. I can’t tell her I’m not a... let’s call it, naturally born human being. It’s hard to get through this, I don’t like direct questions. Fortunately, I’ve had plenty of time to rehearse some answers, during my short existence as a normal woman.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“By absolute chance. The day I arrived to New Langdon from Ireland, I noticed this building and asked myself <em>what kind of idiot would open a flower shop in a harbor?</em>”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Detective Rainer chuckles, out of the blue, interrupting my well-crafted story.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I had the same question. Then, I remembered whom I was dealing with and suddenly everything made sense. Please, continue, though. Don’t let my random quips sway you.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I go back to my memory cupboard, trying to piece together my story again.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Well, huh, so I got to have a look at it, entered and saw all those species of flowers... some of which were so bizarre and exotic that I hadn’t even known they existed. All of a sudden, this fellow comes out from the backroom and starts talking with me. We chat a little, he learns that I’m new and looking for a job, and he ends up offering me a position. He needed someone to deal with the customers while he was working in his lab, or something. Since I didn’t know anybody here and the money seemed adequate, I... huh, just accepted it?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I notice how her eyebrows are bending, much like she’s questioning my life choices. I’m sure I must look weird to her. My body is full of tattoos, and my outfit shows more skin than it covers. It’s still an improvement, especially compared to – you know – not wearing anything at all, but I can see why she would be surprised, and not in a good way.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“That noctiphage... was it already there?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Oh. Huh. That was the sticking point? Our li’l Mr. Kramers?</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yes. I found him adorable.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I see her getting sullen, as if I had just uttered a four-letter-word in her face. She really doesn’t like noctis.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Where I’m from, we terminate them on sight. With extreme prejudice, before they can kill us in turn. Sorry, Ms. Kaleidos, I just can’t understand how you could happily live together with a walking biohazard like that. Maybe I’m just getting old.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Told ya!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Shut up, EiN.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The voice that called her out was that of her colleague. A very tall man, taller than Cyphy. Muscular, yet tin, with neck-long brown hair and gray eyes, wearing leather jackets and ripped jeans, all covered by golden studs shaped like “one”s. EiN, he’s called. Apparently, with a capital N. Go figure. The two of them work for Yard, or so they told me. They look completely antithetical, in a good, cool-minded cop – bad, anger-filled cop kind of way. They are both <em>hounds</em>, part of an elite group of detectives. I’ve watched a documentary about them, on the Reality Oscillation Phenomena they investigate. To think The Walking Night was one of those...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Okay, so you accepted the offer and started working for Mr. Kissilmer. Did you notice anything... strange or out of the ordinary about him? Before yesterday night, I mean.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It would have been easier to answer with what I <em>didn’t </em>notice. Niamm Kissilmer was a walking concentrate of strangeness and didn’t do anything to hide it.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Aside from his horribly gray skin, the missing eye, the patch he’d always wore on his cheek, the constant stench of rotten flesh, his unhealthy obsession with Eliphya, the multiple scars on his right wrist, and the fact that he slept inside a literal coffin? No, not really. He was always paying on time, even if the shop was almost near bankruptcy. We didn’t have many customers, as you may have surmised.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Detective Rainer’s eyes stare right at me, wide-open, as if every item of my list reawakened some memories or repressed experiences. What has this woman in front of me gone through?</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Eliphya, you said.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yup, he was watching re-runs of that series every day and night, ogling the protagonist and saying quite indecent stuff all the time. I hated that.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She seems deep in thought, pondering on her next question.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Listen, Ms. Kaleidos, is there any chance... he mentioned someone going by the name of Baal the Mad, even only once?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“No, I don’t think I’ve heard him mention that one. It was the guy who was connected with the Walking Night, right? Mr. Kissilmer did talk<em> a lot</em> about the Walking Night. And also about this weird Rosenmaester case. They seemed to be his favorite topics, when not lusting for Eliphya. He always complained how people believed Rosenmaester’s flowers to be, well, roses, when in reality they were chrysanthemums.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">And how mad he was, every time someone got that wrong. I remember him getting in an argument with a customer about that. It was insane, I had to stop good old Mr. Kissilmer to sic li’l Kramers at them. I had never seen him in such a state of rage before. Still, this question is... unsettling.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The Night is finding her way back to me, even if I want to keep her out of my life. Every time I think I’m free of that influence, she manages to step in from the back door. I feel a shiver running down my spine. That’s the past, Lejl. Don’t beat yourself about it. It was all a performance, you’ve never been a conduit for the Walking Night. It was just your persona. It was just make-believe. Now, calm down, okay?</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I draw a deep breath, look back at those emerald lakes quizzically gazing at me.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“If anything, Mr. Kissilmer felt a little bit – how can I say – monotone. As in, he used to repeat himself very often, and always about the same stuff. Like a broken record, I guess?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... a broken record?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oh, huh, I mean... like, you know those vinyl music discs, yes? When you play them with a gramophone and the channels are ruined, it might remain stuck over and over on the same part of the track, like a defective echo.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I almost shiver again at those words. A defective echo. This is how he called me, not long after having saved me. A defective echo of Aylin. This is what I am. A violation of causality. For a long time, I haven’t even existed: I’ve just... kind of woke up one day, as a figment of Amy’s psyche. I realized I could read her mind as a book, that I was a guest in her body, but had little to no control over her. It was weird. I could call her, but she wasn’t listening. She didn’t know about me, and I couldn’t understand anything at first. I had to learn, and learn, and learn. And, at some point, I wanted it. I wanted a <em>name</em>.</p>

<p class="western" align="LEFT">Lejl.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">In hindsight, Lejl was a strange choice. It means “night” in Maltese. Pronounced “Layl”. Why did I pick up a Maltese name of Arabic origins? How did I learn about its existence? Sometimes I think I might have been born as a sort of... vortex, capable of ingesting and absorbing residual information from my surroundings. A spinning, spiraling black hole, an anomaly feeding on raw information and turning it into a new part of herself. This is how my conscience formed, by constant assimilation of random bits of fading words, memories, traces attached to the places Aylin was traveling through. Traces that stopped existing, as soon as I consumed them. So, to whom did that fragment of knowledge belong? Who was the person who was thinking about the Maltese word for “night”, when I picked it up? Where were they now? They don’t know which role they had in making me myself, they probably never will.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Do they still remember that word or did me learning about it erased it from their memory? It’s scary to think I could have such an effect on the people around me, yet to have no idea if that was really the case. Lejl. The Night.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It comes full circle again.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">My existence and the night’s aren’t separable. I am Lejl. I am Night.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Ms. Kaleidos?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">My mind movie breaks down, turning the clock back to the current moment, to that blue haired woman interrogating me. Her fragrance catches my attention. Good choice of perfume, very sweet, yet decisive. I need to ask her later what it is. I’d like to buy it to Cyphy. They are more similar than it might look. Same determination, same fire burning in their eyes.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yes, sorry detective Rainer, I just spaced out a little. But, yeah, I was saying that Mr. Kissilmer sometimes felt a little bit like... disconnected from reality, if it makes sense. In more ways than one too. Once, I punched him in the guts – I was seriously angry, okay? And it felt like – I dunno, hitting a bag full of flies. No thud, no impact. Just... the weird feeling of touching something that shouldn’t have been there?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Her lips move slowly, her voice lowered all of a sudden.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“<em>Like a ghost voicing sermons in the streets, among drunkards, without caring whether commoners listen or not, in the cold embrace of his Night.</em>”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I gulp, startled. Those words... those words are...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">An audible sigh interrupts me again – a <em>very </em>loud one. Detective Rainer turns around, ignoring me for a second, waving her hand in the direction of her colleague.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“How come we didn’t find out about this before, EiN? By the book Baal, and he was hiding under our nose, for at least one full year, maybe two!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The other guy shrugs, smirks towards the blue haired lady, showing his perfectly white teeth – almost shining in the dim light of the store.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I was on paternity leave, Veckert... aaaand you were dealing with being single <em>again</em>, dismantling yet another drug cartel, paying for emergency reparations for Blame, and a lot of yadda yadda. Shit happens.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Well, it shouldn’t have. Not with <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Veckert. That’s another weird name, heard it only seldom and only in the news. Sounds like a German name, but I’m pretty sure she isn’t. From her accent, I’d gander she’s Irish, just like Paddy. Maybe they know each other? That would indeed be a curious coincidence. I don’t think they’d get along, though. This Veckert seems hellbent in hating phages, while Paddy is completely on the other end of the spectrum. They would probably murder each other at first sight. And Chai would be sitting there, munching pop-corns and enjoying the show, like the gremlin she is, while betting on which one would survive with Cyphy.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“He wasn’t even half subtle. Niamm Kissilmer – he just rearranged the letters of his name! And, apparently, this Kissilmer’s face showed the very same gun wounds Baal suffered four years ago. It can’t be a coincidence, can it? It <em>must</em> have been him.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She stares at her colleague with what I can only define as <em>quiet disapproval</em>. This woman is pure fire, bottled up energy on the verge of exploding, but still manages to keep a cool demeanor. I wish I was more like her. Still, I don’t understand. Why does she keep calling Mr. Kissilmer “Baal”? That’s the name of some ancient deity – or demon. If she’s correct... who was <em>really</em> Niamm Kissilmer? Did he lie to me from the beginning, from the day he saved me from the Shadow Gallery? But why?</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">
  <em>He just rearranged the letters of his name.</em>
</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">There’s no way Niamm Kissilmer is an anagram of “Baal the Mad”. Then, which name...? I start delving into my own mind, diving into my consciousness to grasp it, to <em>understand</em> it. The fragments of information that I have absorbed, that I have kept on assimilating, are like vortexes in my brain, taking that unremarkable sequence of letters apart, breaking it down, combining it again in a plethora of possible outcomes, outcomes I have never thought about until now.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Niamm Kissilmer.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Niammkis Silmer.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Silmer Niammkis.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Silmen Enimmkis.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Silman Serimmik.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Excuse me, Ms. Kaleidos...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Detective Rainer interrupts my thoughts again. I felt I was so near, so near to having a revelation. Mr. Kissilmer deceived me from the start? I was so naive to trust him, because he saved me. A bad person wouldn’t have saved something like me from the Gallery, right? I can’t accept that the bizarre, weird Mr. Kissilmer I used to know and bear, I used to laugh with, I used to see closed in his casket, was... someone else. Someone unknown. A complete stranger, masked as a weird yet apparently well-meaning flower artist. I store my thoughts aside, stare again at that blue-haired woman.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yes, detective?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I know it might be hard for you, but... I need to ask you a couple more questions about... what you’ve seen. This time, the full story.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">A shiver.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">What I’ve seen.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I don’t think I’ll be able to forget that soon. Just three days ago, Paddy was here, checking on Mr. Kramers’s health and bickering with Mr. Kissilmer. We found the sand blood flower inside my bunnies, inside our pet nocti’s stomach. It shouldn’t have attacked mammals. Yet, that specimen did. Sucked them dry. Of course, we called the police and the biohazard team. Of course, they didn’t believe us, thought it was another publicity stunt, due to Paddy being Paddy. Sand blood flowers, sprouting from rabbits. Jumping species. They wouldn’t believe it. So, they didn’t come, not for two days at least. Yet, yesterday evening, when I reached the shop for my night shift, something was wrong.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The tape we had used to secure the small hut with the infected, dead bunnies had been ripped, torn apart. Paddy told me not to enter it, for any reason whatsoever, but I couldn’t, I wouldn’t leave this to chance. Thus, I slammed open the door.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">And found nothing.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The bunnies were gone. The flowers were gone. As if they hadn’t existed in the first place. It was jarring. I didn’t know what to think. Dead animals can’t walk away. Mr. Kramers would have left a mess of bones and blood around, if he ate them. But the hut was clean. Clean as it never was before.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Then, I heard it.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">That lament.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It’s Mr. Kramers. He’s wailing, crying. I run for the entrance, have my way inside. Lights are down, only the moon dimly shining from the windows. And Mr. Kramers bioluminescent bands. He’s there, scratching the interior door, the door to the lab, yelping helplessly. He’s scared. He’s <em>scared of something</em>. I have never seen him like that. I sit near him, pet him, try to calm him down.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">And I <em>feel</em> it.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The stench. The horrible stench of rotten meat.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Coming from the lab.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Mr. Kissilmer, are you there?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">No response. Only the sound of the TV speakers. Crackling, distorted. I recognized it, it’s the same episode he watched so many times. He has to be inside, right? Why would the TV be on, otherwise? I bring my hand to my nose, cover it. That smell. Unbearable. I grab the handle, wait for a second.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Mr. Kissilmer?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Silence again. Mr. Kramers runs away, find shelter in his own little hut. I let him go. I need to understand.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">At that point, I pulled the handle, unlocked the door, opened it.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Then,</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">I</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">screamed.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Yes, I might have screamed. I think I did. I can remember a voice, probably my voice. I must have fallen on the floor too, incapable of believing my own very eyes.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">In the dark. All in chaos.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Vials and tools. On the floor.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">The TV. Still showing Eliphya. Same re-run. Her death scene, stuck on a loop.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">And, in front of it. A cocoon.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Big, as big as a man.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Ripped from inside out.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Torn, burst open.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Plant matter, vines spreading.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">But its shape. Was not that of a plant.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Its shape. The cocoon.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Was his body.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Mr. Kissilmer’s body.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">I</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">screamed,</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">again.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">His gray skin.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">His thin fingers.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">His violet eye.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Wide open.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">A grimace.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Of joy.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Uncontrollable laughter.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">As the rafflesia flowers.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Sprouted from his heart.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Lungs.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Kidneys.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Bones.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Muscles.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Mouth.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Nose.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Skin.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">I</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">screamed.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Not a man.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Not a corpse.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Just a plant.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">In human shape.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Or something.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">That isn’t here.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Anymore.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">I</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">screamed</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">screamed</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">screamed</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">SCREAMED.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">The window open,</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">the glass cracked.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Mr. Kissilmer is not here.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Not anymore.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">But was he ever?</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">I scream</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">and run</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Run</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">RUN</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">RUN</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">RUN</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">RUN</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">RUN</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Run</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">run.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">Faint.</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Next thing I remember, is waking up on the bare asphalt, just out of the shop. Mr. Kramers licking my face, trying to wake me up. What have I seen? What was there, inside the lab? What was it? What? I don’t remember. I can’t remember. I don’t WANT to remember. I just...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Ms. Kaleidos?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I throw up. I throw up on detective Rainer. And again. And again. Until nothing remains in my stomach. That thing. That... construct in the shape of a man. That empty cocoon. What was that. What was that? What was THAT? I almost faint. Again. I didn’t want to think. I didn’t want to remember.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Dammit! EiN! Quick!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I see the world spinning, in a vortex without end, I close my eyes. When I open them again, I see those emerald lakes, those blue strands. Veckert Rainer is leaning over me, she’s cleaning my mouth. I’m in shambles. But those images... those pictures...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Don’t worry, Lejl. May I call you Lejl? It happens, I’ve seen worse. Now, calm down. Want us to call someone? Your partner? Your parents?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I sit down on the floor, looking at Veckert, staring at the man she called EiN, gazing around, a this shop, my shop, my world. Chrysanthemums. Everywhere. No roses. No roses at all. Every kind of flower except roses. I get it now. I get it. He was him. <em>It</em> was him.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">That person.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">How could I be so stupid?</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">How could I trust him?</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chrysanthemums</p>

<p class="western" align="RIGHT">and no roses.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It’s with horror that I realize it. I’ve worked for a mass murderer. I’ve laughed with him. Played cards with him. Fed a noctiphage with him. Planted trees with him. Cut leaves with him. Yet, he was none other than...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">I feel like I’m gonna puke. I feel like I need to throw up again. That thing was not a man. That thing... what was that thing?</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Lejl, breathe. Breathe, please. It’s over, he’s not going to hurt you. He’s gone... for now.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Detective Rainer’s voice is weird. I can’t get accustomed to it. Yet, I can feel her genuine concern. She dealt with him. She had faced him. I’m sure. I’m sure of it. Steps. Noise of steps. Someone exits from the backroom. A scientist. White, neck-long, straight hair. Albino, maybe. Young.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Veckert? We’ve finished the analysis of the sample.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“And?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">He shakes his head, I can see his eyes wavering.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“His body... it’s a miracle that it didn’t decompose sooner. His cells were basically dead. And plants... replaced his skin, his muscles, every part that was breaking down, as time went by. There was a flower in his empty eye socket, and another in the hole in his cheek, where you shot him four years ago. His broken bones were kept together by vines. It’s... I don’t even know how to describe this. That... thing defies all logic. It’s an abomination, something that shouldn’t exist! Veckert, what I wanted to say is that... Baal the Mad... no, Silman Simmerik...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">He shivers, he doesn’t seem to be able to talk. I hear what he says. I hear all his words.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... was already a corpse in 2062, when you met him for the first time...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">But I can’t believe it. I can’t understand it. I can’t grasp it.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... and whatever was inhabiting his flesh...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">He stares at the window, at the open window in the back room, surrounded by countless shards of glass.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... now is out there... in some shape or form.”</p>
