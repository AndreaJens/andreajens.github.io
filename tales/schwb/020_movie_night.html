    <p><em>June 2067. A chill slice of life story about four disasterrific friends watching an action movie with space lizards and a trigger-happy protagonist.</em></p>
  </div>

<hr>
<p class="western">“Why, Kaspar Killgeyzer? You world is dead! DEAD! And you keep on fighting? Is that for revenge? Do you want revenge?”</p>

<p class="western">A red dinosaur in a black military uniform, a blade through his chest, bleeding, staring at a man. Long coat, ripped, large cowboy hat, shark teeth, triangle shades. And a four-barrel revolver. A smile on the jagged teeth, his tongue licking the thin lips.</p>

<p class="western">“No.”</p>

<p class="western">The weapon aimed at the forehead, the scared eyes of the reptilian, looking at that face, the smiling face of his executioner.</p>

<p class="western">“I just like boobs.”</p>

<p class="western">Then, the shot.</p>

<p class="western">One. Two. Three times.</p>

<p class="western">Paddy shoved her face in her palms, incapable of watching, screaming in silence, almost on the verge of tears. She couldn’t stand that scene. She gritted her teeth, as the red dinosaur’s head exploded in a cloud of blood, as the background turned red and Kaspar became nothing more than a black silhouette. Silence settled. She breathed a little, her eyes peeked out of her fingers. Only for Kaspar to shoot one more time, at the mangled corpse of his opponent. Paddy brought her hand to her lips, her grief bottled up, her eyes getting unreasonably wet too.</p>

<p class="western">“S... sergeant Scalehide...? W...”</p>

<p class="western">She couldn’t keep it in, not anymore.</p>

<p class="western">“WHY?! Why did you kill him, monster?! WHY?!”</p>

<p class="western">She lifted her arm, her fingers in the direction of the lifeless body, falling down to pieces. Until a hand grabbed hers, pushed her down on her seat.</p>

<p class="western">“Oi, stop the ruckus.”</p>

<p class="western">A crunching noise of chewed popcorn, annoyed ever-shifting irises gazing at her with nothing short of contempt. Paddy blinked a couple times, before understanding what had happened. She shrunk on her seat, trying to disappear in the background. But it was already too late. The whole cinema was looking in her direction. Quiet laughter, some fingers pointed at her. She blushed, wanted to vanish, possibly without nobody noticing. Yet, that wasn’t possible. Not for the next half an hour, at least. Not until the credits rolled.</p>

<p class="western">“... sorry...”</p>

<p class="western">She heard a chuckle, this time from another nearby seat. Another set of eyes – this time yellow and bright, were looking at her, in conjunction with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p class="western">“Someone here loves her lizards, huh?”</p>

<p class="western">She rolled her eyes. <em>Technically</em>, that was not a lizard, as dinosaurs shared more similarities with birds than with modern-day crocodiles, but telling that to Lejl wouldn’t have improved her position – only made it more obnoxious. The fact that she asked herself how it would feel to be in bed with said dinosaur was totally irrelevant too and would have just added more fuel to the fire. Thus, she replied in the only way she knew – by pushing Lejl’s forehead away, with her open palm, while grumbling something unintelligible. On the screen, the man called Kaspar Killgeyzer was now riding a chopper with a machine-gun mounted at each side of the fuel cover, mowing down robots left and right while wheeling on a dubstep track. Noise of chewed popcorn again, somehow getting faster as the scene unfolded. Paddy found the strength to look at the source of those sounds, at the owner of that dangling, rusty peace medallion that was swinging with every movement of her hand. At her dumb smile. It was a weird view. Chai, without her blindfold, that blindfold that had been such an important part of herself. Watching a movie in a cinema, for the first time in her life, enjoying every second of it. She had already drank two cans of Frogga-Cola and munched down three cans of pop-corn. That was the fourth. And she was laughing, having a hard time keeping her emotions in check.</p>

<p class="western">“Oi, that execution scene was all wrong. A head doesn’t explode that way! And so much blood? Come on!”</p>

<p class="western">And she laughed, and laughed again, from the bottom of her heart, risking to choke on her snacks. More amused than annoyed. On the other hand, Cyphr didn’t seem to be “there”. Her mind felt distant. She was staring blankly at the screen, but at the same time her eyes looked lost in thought. Paddy didn’t want to investigate, but it indeed felt odd. Cyphr didn’t seem to like to tag along, but didn’t feel like not joining either. Yet, there she was, watching but not watching, as Kaspar Killgeyzer started fighting a giant mechanical golem, his motorbike running up an infinite spiral staircase. Lejl, instead, was just stealing pop-corn from Chai every couple of minutes, also having the time of her life – especially during the two shower scenes of the female lead Lili Formosa, and during the shootout where she fought completely in the nude and uncensored against a cadre of zombie dinosaurs, while armed with two uzis with seemingly bottomless magazines.</p>

<p class="western">Paddy sighed. She knew it, she had it coming. No way a movie like Chronoslasherz 3090 could end well for the villains – especially considered the kill count of Kaspar Killgeyzer in his first feature film. Yet, she hoped sergeant Scalehide, an exceptionally good-looking, red-scaled dinosaur who was anticipated as the most prominent secondary antagonist, would have at least received a proper send-off – not that unnecessary gore-fest of a summary execution.</p>

<p class="western">“He didn’t deserve it. He didn’t! That’s not fair!”</p>

<p class="western">“Huh?”</p>

<p class="western">Cyphr was shaken out of her trance, her metallic arms shining in the dark room, lit only by the projectors. She didn’t really manage to focus on the plot. Shooting, explosions, flying severed limbs, demons, zombies, guns... it was all a weird mixture of colors and shapes, in her mind. Nothing that could interest her, but that had a sort of magnetic attraction on that horny gremlin she got as a girlfriend and to her much too passionate friends.</p>

<p class="western">“I mean it, Sif! It’s such a waste! Such a waste! Goddammit!”</p>

<p class="western">Cyphr nodded without really meaning it. In six months, she went from being the loneliest loner to going out every other week, hanging out with her small group of friends, playing games, watching TV shows, doing sports, and even – albeit very, very rarely – adding the “with benefits” tag to the “friends” part. Despite that, whatever intimate shenanigans had happened in the past, she had kept a couple of secrets for herself – something she didn’t want them to find out at any cost.</p>

<p class="western">“Yeah. They could have gone for another idea.”</p>

<p class="western">“See? See? That’s exactly how it is!”</p>

<p class="western">“Oi, shut up!”</p>

<p class="western">Before Paddy could do anything, Chai slapped her on her nape, causing a moan of pain to escape from her lips. Cyphr groaned. Among the four of them, she was the most introvert and didn’t really enjoy social activities. In a moderate amount? Sure. Those three disasters were the best thing that had ever happened to her after getting to know Tiger and killing Krave. But every other week? That was too much. Especially now that Magical Unicorn Friends was wrapping its sixth installment. Cyphr loved that cartoon. It had been her comfort show for the last two years, one season at a time, one episode per week. It was catered towards little girls, at lest on the surface, and the eponymous unicorns were so cute she would melt every time a new character joined the roster. Yet, her favorite was, without doubt, Sunshine Spark. Sunshine had been a late addition, around the time the main writer changed after the first one was fired on sexual harassment charges, and quickly became a fan-favorite. Contrary to all other unicorns, she was artificially created by minor villain Bandam to fight series protagonist Moonlight Shadow, but ended up turning on her master and slowly managing to get accepted by the other characters. During the second-to-last season, she had a heart-wrenching arc where the main villain Nightveil severed one of her legs and shattered her horn, completely stripping her of her magic and leaving her to die, not considering her even worthy of killing. That had been so emotionally devastating that Cyphr had called in sick the day after, staring at the ceiling for the whole morning while tucked under her bed sheets, tears in eyes. All for a fictional character. If Lejl got wind of it, she would have never lived it down. And now, after a whole rollercoaster season that culminated in the death of fan-favorite, team mascot Dashing Cloud, the last episode, the grand finale, the confrontation between a renewed Sunshine Spark and Nightveil, was unfolding right as she was forced to watch a psychotic killer fighting nazi dinosaurs in space. With a four-barrel revolver. While riding a motorcycle. With a half-naked woman on the backseat pushing her boobs against his back.</p>

<p class="western">Cyphr sighed. She couldn’t focus on that pathetic excuse of movie. Lejl and Chai seemed to be having the time of their lives, and she was kind of happy for them. First time for Chai in a cinema since their gift, since the night she was finally allowed not to pose as blind. She was visibly excited, laughing maniacally and criticizing every scene, but still enjoying the experience, from the bottom of her heart, constantly giggling like a little girl. In the end, despite everything she had gone through, she was still a kid inside, a kid that never had the chance to live her childhood... a bit like her. Their stories had been eerily similar. Both of them had their lives stolen. Both of them fought tooth and nail to find their own little island of happiness.</p>

<p class="western">Like Sunshine Spark.</p>

<p class="western">Cyphr gritted her teeth, shook her head. Joyco Toys, the company behind Magical Unicorn Friends, was extremely strict with broadcasting. No video on demand. No reruns. Every episode was a <em>unique collective experience</em>. Piracy was not an option either: uploads were struck down with unthinkable effectiveness, with cyber hounds scanning the net at any given moment and making it virtually impossible for an illegitimate copy to exist for more than mere <em>minutes</em>. Which meant, watch it when it airs or lose it – unless you were ready to pay gigabucks for the collector edition three months later... or you had access to a not exactly legal stream capture card to store the episode. The latter might or might not have been what Cyphr had setup at home, borrowing it from the Delta Team equipment, just to record an episode of a cartoon. Something none of her friends would have ever been allowed to know.</p>

<p class="western">“Killgeyzer! Fancy seeing you here! Just in time to watch your planet burn... just as we watched ours burn because of <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p class="western">A tall, muscular cyborg tyrannosaurus was standing on screen, in front of an army of robots, a giant glass dome opening on Earth behind him, hate and resentment in his voice. Kaspar jumped off his motorcycle, drew his gun, grinned.</p>

<p class="western">“Do you think I’d care? I’d gladly watch my world turning into ashes, if it means more fun for me.”</p>

<p class="western">The tyrannosaurus growled, stared at him with utter disbelief.</p>

<p class="western">“You can’t possibly be this insane, Killgeyzer!”</p>

<p class="western">Kaspar shrugged, pointed his revolver at him, cocked it.</p>

<p class="western">“Come on, push that lever. Burn Earth to a crisp, Dinovan. Do it, do me this favor. Free me from the only reason I have to hold back. So that I can MASSACRE you all, to my heart’s content, until the HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE!”</p>

<p class="western">Chai burst into laughter, almost choked on her popcorn, tears in her eyes. She spit her cola, bent forward, not managing to stop.</p>

<p class="western">“Oi! OI! That’s <em>so dumb</em>! So goddamn cheesy! Just shoot him, for chrissake!”</p>

<p class="western">On the opposite side, Paddy was shaking her head, praying, her hands joined.</p>

<p class="western">“No, no, no! Don’t shoot him! He’s just misunderstood! Dinovan did nothing wrong!”</p>

<p class="western">All other moviegoers started groaning, someone contemplating throwing a shoe or another heavy object at those two noisy girls chatting in the third row. Cyphr groaned too. That plot was becoming more and more absurd, and she couldn’t stop thinking about Sunshine Spark. Was she going to beat Nightveil? Was she going to finally be accepted by Moonlight Shadow as a friend and not as a thing? Would they kiss? No, of course not, no kissing in kids cartoons, but the fan fiction websites were full of Sunlight and Moonshine stories. She didn’t adhere to any of the two rabid fandom currents. In her opinion, those two would have been better as friends – accepting each other for what they were, without any romantic involvement. She couldn’t wait for getting back home and saving the export on...</p>

<p class="western">A sudden chill down her spine.</p>

<p class="western">Did she connect the storage unit to the capture card? Chai and Paddy had showed up out of the blue to take her and Lejl to the cinema, so she hurried all preparations but...</p>

<p class="western">
  <em>No, no, no, no.</em>
</p>

<p class="western">She didn’t. She was pretty sure that she didn’t. She shoved her face in her palms, almost to the point of breaking in tears. That was bad. That was <em>so</em> bad. That meant three months of wait and a sizable chunk of her salary, while avoiding the internet to steer clear from spoilers. She wanted to cry.</p>

<p class="western">“Killgeyzeeeer! I’m dying, but your planet... your planet will come with me!”</p>

<p class="western">A colossal particle beam pulverized the Moon, burned the atmosphere, a storm of fire and death, as it pierced through Earth like a knife through butter. The oceans evaporated, cities crumbled, mountains broke down. The Earth crust exploded, the mantel too, the core shattered, as the planet once called cradle of mankind turned into space dust, breaking down to smithereens in a spectacular explosion, under the impassible gaze of Kaspar.</p>

<p class="western">Earth was no more. Only emptiness and screams, screams that were lost in the void of space. Silence fell into the room, as Dinovan collapsed on his knees, his green blood pouring on the metallic floor of the space station.</p>

<p class="western">“R... revenge. At... last.”</p>

<p class="western">Then, he drew his last breath. Kaspar bent over him, closed his eyelids.</p>

<p class="western">“Rest well, Dinovan. It was a pleasure facing you again.”</p>

<p class="western">“W... what do we do now?”</p>

<p class="western">Lili Formosa reached for Kaspar, looking at where her planet was, not even one minute before. Kaspar grinned, showed her his ring. Triumphal music, the zoom on his grin, on the body of Lili quietly wrapped around his dirty longcoat.</p>

<p class="western">“What we always do. We have <em>all the time in the multiverse</em>, babe.”</p>

<p class="western">Then, he turned it around his finger three times. A bright white light enveloped them, blinding the camera, the viewers. Then, in an instant, they disappeared, in a beam directed to the endless space.</p>

<p class="western">Lights on.</p>

<p class="western">Cheerful pop music.</p>

<p class="western">Credits rolled.</p>

<p class="western">
  <em>Kaspar and Lili will return in...</em>
</p>

<p class="western">
  <em>Chronoslasherz 5090 – The End of Eternity</em>
</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER">
  <em>**</em>
</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Like, that was certainly a way to end a movie, huh?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, at least it was fun. But, if you ask me, the violence was completely unrealistic. I bet this new director has never seen a head exploding! And, wow, Chronoslasherz’ fans are fumigating online! Look at the reviews! ”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yes, indeed <em>we</em> are fumigating! Like, come on! That ending was so Dumb, with a capital D!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... at least Dinovan died fulfilling his revenge. I found it cathartic for him. He won. He forced Kaspar to look for a new universe to settle, after he spent so much time getting accustomed to that...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, that mofo changes planet like I change underwear! Have you seen any shred of regret? He was totally unfazed!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I swear, I’ll boycott 5090! They didn’t even give us a full sex scene, this time around!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Shut up, you horny gremlin! You can watch, you know, real porn, if you are so hellbent in seeing a busty woman getting off!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cyphr stood silent, as her three friends were lost in a torrent of comments. She couldn’t think straight. Her capture card wasn’t connected. She had spent a terrible movie evening with the one saving grace of watching Magical Unicorn Friends later and then...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Sif, what did you think of it?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cyphr raised her gaze, looking straight at Paddy.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“That I would have rather spent two hours watching the paint dry. Seriously, that crap was a full no-go for me. Next time you want to watch an action flick... not like this one, ‘kay? I have already had my fair share of violence in my life.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai sighed.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I’m sorry, Cyphr. I wasn’t expecting it either. The first movie was... let’s say different. A bit more grounded. Less gruesome. Still over the top, but more... balanced?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yeah! And <em>way, way </em>sexier! That threesome scene was truly something else!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai and Paddy rolled their eyes at Lejl’s remark. Cyphr chuckled. Her girlfriend and she weren’t <em>that </em>different in terms of cravings. The only thing Cyphr was better at was <em>hiding it in plain sight</em>. Hiding her emotions had been the name of the game for her, for years. That was quite useful at times, especially as Lejl was the complete opposite – and she loved her <em>exactly</em> because of that. It was funny to see Chai, a literal erotic streamer, and Paddy, whose exploits with phages had been the matter of essays, being flustered by Lejl’s demeanor. Of all people that should have been scandalized by her, those two weren’t even remotely on the list. Still, a silver lining for that terrible evening. She was still happy for Chai. She truly enjoyed it, despite not liking the movie, and she could understand why. Being able to finally break out of her shell...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It had been the same for her, the moment she finally got familiar with her prosthetic arms. It was a new beginning. A new life, even. Thus, she smiled.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Well, at least someone had fun, so it wasn’t a complete failure, or?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Then, she turned towards the door of the building, that building in Turing Avenue Lejl and she shared a flat in.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Have a good night, gals! Gotta meet another time. I’m dying of sleep.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Paddy waved her hand with vigor, Chai saluted her with two fingers.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, till next time, Cyphr. I’ll be sure to choose a movie more in your tunes!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Would you like something cuter, maybe? Like Magi...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, come on!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Before Paddy could finish her sentence, Chai pushed her palm on her mouth, pulled her away, waving her hand too, while dragging the Irish girl down the road. Cyphr watched them with a mixture of surprise and resignation. Those two were weird. Not as weird as Lejl, but still weird. And that’s why they were friends, probably.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">With the late night pleasantries settled, Cyphr walked up the stairs to her flat, waited for Lejl to arrive, opened the door. She was scared. Scared of looking towards her PC. Scared of remembering of how she botched the recording of the only series that mattered. She closed her eyes. She felt like crying again at that thought. Everything just because she was too stubborn to tell her friends she liked a kid series. Because she didn’t want to be seen as uncool and left alone. That was her freshly-out-of-teens brain gaslighting her. They probably would have accepted her even if she told them about her secret, but she didn’t want to let them know.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Huh, Cyphy, what’s this thing-y blinking here?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She opened her eyes, looked towards the computer. The streaming card.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It was connected.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">And blinking blue.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">As in...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Recording complete?!</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She couldn’t believe it. She brought a hand to her mouth, started sobbing. The episode. The episode had been recorded? But...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“J... just a work-related hard drive, Lalli. I forgot it... connected to my PC and...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Ah, got it.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Lejl yawned, stretched a little bit.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Listen, this evening I’m not in the mood for some <em>hot-Cyphy-on-Lejl-action</em>. I’m going directly to sleep. If you ain’t tired yet and need to mess with your computer, just be sure to use earplugs.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Before Cyphr could say anything, Lejl tiptoed up to her face, pulled her down a bit, kissed her on her lips.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Good night, babe!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">
  <span>Then she went away, leaving Cyphr alone with her PC. With a dumb smile on her face and a fresh copy of the season finale of Magical Unicorn Friends to watch. Lejl chuckled, as soon as she vanished inside their common bedroom. That blockhead had forgotten to connect the plug. How could have she forgotten to connect the plug? Lejl had fixed it for her, seconds before leaving their flat. Of course she knew about it. She knew about her girlfriend’s passion for that cartoon series and how she tried her best to hide it from her. But, as much as she tried, Cyphy was a bad liar. Lejl started to undress, take her nightgown out of the cupboard, closed her eyes as she listened to the muffled sounds of a cheerful tune playing, out of Cyphr’s earplugs. She peeked out of her room, just a little, only to catch a glimpse of her smile, reflected on the computer display, as colorful images began showing up on it. Then, she went back to her bedroom, with a weird, satisfied smile on her face.</span>
