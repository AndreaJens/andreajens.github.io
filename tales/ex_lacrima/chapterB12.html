In today&rsquo;s fourth hour, the swarm finished consuming the hinterland of its core urban area, clocking at a distance of twenty kilometer of radius from Lagash. Haagen, in the southernmost part of the country, has been chosen as the temporary capital, while countermeasures are under scrutiny. Most of the population of the Northern Fringe has been relocated, but the casualties attributed to the swarm are already in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions.&rdquo;</p>

<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">&ldquo;&hellip;Peacekeeper squadrons sent into the &lsquo;ashen field&rsquo; around the seedship Lagash have managed to enter the flight deck, before being surprised by a second wave of nanos and annihilated in mere seconds. Dr. Mangelow, what could it mean? Could it be that the seedship is programmed to send nanos in &lsquo;waves&rsquo; with &lsquo;calms&rsquo; in between?&rdquo;</p>
