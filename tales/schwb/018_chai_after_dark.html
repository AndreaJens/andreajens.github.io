    <p><em>June 2067. Returning from a trip to a nearby supermarket, Chai finds three familiar faces waiting for her with a gift - a gift connected with her life before knowing Red... and maybe the beginning of something new.</em></p>

<hr>
<p class="western">Chai passed her fingertip on the braille description of the item, rolled her eyes in disbelief. She looked at the shelf, pretending not to do that, then touched the small sequence of dots in a wide swipe. The label, those small extrusions on the paper-thin plastic, spelled the words “Tomato Soup”. In reality, what was in front of her, was a can of peas, of the same size and shape as what usually occupied that spot. She was seeing that clearly, from the other side of her one-directional blindfold. Yet, what if she had been blind for real and not <em>pretending to be blind</em>, for the safety of all people around her? Would have she taken that can, bought it, and then found out about the difference once she got home? A cold shiver down her spine. Visually impaired people did have it hard, especially when the personnel at the supermarket was <em>that</em> level of idiotic. She grabbed a real can of soup, still pretending not to be able to see, then she carefully navigated the corridors, using a cane. It had been weird to have to learn to move that way. Chai’s sight was almost perfect. Yet, she had been forced to watch the world through a black silk screen since when she was not even ten years old. She had been <em>legally blind </em>for her whole adult life, with all what came with the package. At least, that made her somehow more of a novelty, when she started her erotic streaming career.</p>

<p class="western">She reached for the check-in, where a sleepy girl in her early twenties was serving her night shift. She was quite tall, sporing a brown ponytail, dressed with a standard Molco cashier outfit, lazily waiting for her shift to end – yawning too. It was ten o’clock in the night, and there was no other customer around. Chai used to go that late to shop because it reduced the chances to stumble into a bunch of people and accidentally lose her blindfold. That happened once, and the result hadn’t been nice. Furthermore, she had learned to know all the late night employees, sometimes even having small chats with them. That one was new, though. Never seen her at Molco, maybe a student in need of some money and taking on odd jobs?</p>

<p class="western">Chai decided to ask her later, just for some idle chat. She laid her items on the counter, one after another, with a monotonous rhythm. She stopped for an instant. The cashier was looking at her, almost as awoken from her state of lethargy. Chai feigned indifference, kept on emptying her bag. She had to learn to never behave as if she could see. All her life, hiding behind her blindfold. Even during her most prized, intimate moments. She could never open her eyes while being kissed, while having the time of her life. Because, if she did, her pupils would have moved. Because, if she did, someone would have had to die.</p>

<p class="western">Thus, even if the cashier was looking at her, and she was completely aware of it, she tried her best to ignore her. Most likely, she was taken aback by her appearance, or by that rusted peace locket she always used to wear, or simply by her blindfold. The girl at the check-in counter never averted her gaze from her, while scanning each item and putting it aside. She kept her eyes on her even while pushing virtual buttons on the display, calculating the total due.</p>

<p class="western">“It’s £45,50. Cash, card or print?”</p>

<p class="western">“Print, thanks.”</p>

<p class="western">Chai proffered her hand, as she was used to do. Payment via fingerprint was extremely comfortable in her situation, but of course needed a little bit of external help to work, especially for someone who couldn’t <em>legally </em>see. The cashier took her hand gently, pushed her index finger on a black surface. The led turned green. Payment successful.</p>

<p class="western">“Do you need a receipt?”</p>

<p class="western">“No, thanks, I’m good.”</p>

<p class="western">The cashier’s eyes hovered on the display, on the name written there, then locked in on her again, while a weird blush was spreading on her face. Once again, Chai pretended not to notice.</p>

<p class="western">“Say... huh, if I am not too indiscreet... are you by chance... BlindSeraphim?”</p>

<p class="western">Chai grinned.</p>

<p class="western">
  <em>So, that was it.</em>
</p>

<p class="western">She turned around to face the girl, while trying to avoid eye contact.</p>

<p class="western">“Oi, what if I were?”</p>

<p class="western">At that signature <em>oi</em>, the girl blushed even further, almost on the point of giggling. She looked around a couple times, as if to be sure not to be seen or heard by anybody, started talking almost in a whisper.</p>

<p class="western">“I can’t believe it! BlindSeraphim in our hard-discount store? During my first night shift?!”</p>

<p class="western">Chai could see her excitement building up, something akin to joy in her eyes. She wished she could have reacted to it without blowing up her cover.</p>

<p class="western">“I’m a regular here. This Molco gives the best bang for my bucks – aaaand it’s open till 3AM. Very handy after a stream, ’specially when I crave some freshly heated-up pizza after an orgasm or two. You’ve got the best Asian by-the-pound-take-away here.”</p>

<p class="western">The girl’s eyes shone with something resembling joy, at that remark.</p>

<p class="western">“Name’s Lita! My boyfriend and I watch all your streams together! We also... huh, take a lot of inspiration! My li’l Miles can be a devil, when he’s up for it! And, if we ended up getting together, it’s all thanks to you, Ms. BlindSeraphim! We’re still studying and that’s my first job during college, so we can only subscribe to your base tier, but...”</p>

<p class="western">“Hey, it’s enough, don’t sweat it.”</p>

<p class="western">That girl was surely in need to talk, it was funny for Chai to see her excited like a little rabbit. Sadly, all that commotion was filtered by the blackness of the fabric wrapping her eyes. Chai was tempted to rip off her blindfold, to watch that fan of hers in full colors. But she couldn’t. She knew that she couldn’t. It was always the same story, trapped in that sepia cage of hers. If God existed, he surely derived a singular pleasure in having them so near to what she had ever wanted, yet so far.</p>

<p class="western">“C... can I...?”</p>

<p class="western">Lita brought Chai’s hand to her own cheek, as if she wanted her to “see” her behind her blackness. Chai let her do that. She didn’t have the heart to tell her that she didn’t – in fact – have any vision deficit and that she was just playing a part. Chai let her guide her hand on her nose, on her forehead, on her head.</p>

<p class="western">“Oi, call me Chai. Ms. BlindSeraphim izza mouthful and that’s just sorta my stage name.”</p>

<p class="western">“M... may I?!”</p>

<p class="western">“You may.”</p>

<p class="western">Before Lita could say anything else, Chai grabbed her and pressed her lips against her own, letting her tongue do the rest of the job, french kissing her for five short, interminable seconds. Then, she let her go, savored her confused expression, her eyes wide open, her cheeks red to the point of burning. Chai grinned, wiped her saliva with her thumb.</p>

<p class="western">“Aaaah, just what I needed! By the way, <em>that</em> was my <em>good luck</em> kiss, Lit. I reserve it to the new employees of my favorite supermarket, ya know, the first time they recognize me.”</p>

<p class="western">She browsed her pocket, took out a plastic card with a number on it.</p>

<p class="western">“This is for you too. One year of free subscription to my Booner, platinum tier. You and your sweet half gotta save that juicy money for studyin’, otherwise you both gonna risk wasting your life like me.”</p>

<p class="western">Lita was dumbfounded, her fingers wrapped around the small card, her face oscillating between scarlet and vermilion, still unable to process what had just happened. As soon as she found the strength to look up again at her improbable customer, she was already gone, like a shadow in the night. Or an angel under the moonlight.</p>

<p class="western"><br />

<p class="western" align="CENTER">**</p>

<p class="western" align="CENTER"><br />
<br />
</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">At ten fifteen, the night was still relatively young. The path from the Molco to her apartment was relatively short, but having to cross it while pretending to be blind was sometimes annoying. At times, she wished she could just blow her cover, care about nothing and stop restraining herself so much at every single step. Yet, in her heart, she knew that she couldn’t. Ange and Uncle Ni... Roger had tried their damned best to keep her out of harm’s way, and, as much as she resented them for their over-protectiveness, she couldn’t really blame them for it.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She was Medusa, a walking, talking bioweapon capable of paralyzing any human being simply by staring at them in their eyes. Her irises were dangerous. <em>She</em> was dangerous. The only thing that saved her from becoming yet another lab rat had been the year spent with her putative father, that Red – or Donner Misterkay – that taught her how to pretend to be blind – mostly, in order to get sympathy and a couple dimes thrown at her when begging at the side of the street. Yeah, Red being Red probably had a bigger impact on her psyche than she would have liked to admit, but at least helped her making peace with herself. In her opinion, all that scaffolding and theater was just a huge, colossal exaggeration. Her eyes couldn’t kill, not alone, and someone who ended up under her “spell” had all their voluntary body functions shut down for a good twenty minutes, maybe half an hour – then, became immune to her gaze for a couple days. Something something their brain adapting themselves to her patterns, but only for a short time. She had found out about this weird adaptive response by chance, during a girls’ night out with Cyphr, Lejl, and Paddy, three of the few people outside of Crossbones that knew about her condition. She enjoyed hanging out with them, and it had been refreshing for her to be able <em>not to act blind </em>in front of someone, for a change. Thus, once in a while, they met for some cozy indoor activities, like tabletop games, drinking, or just watching movies together. In those rare moments, Chai could just be Chai. She prized each and every one of them, as seldom as they happened. After all, Cyphr and Lejl were living together and could hang out even without her, while Paddy was a famous – pardon, notorious – biologist who wrote a book about having sex with hematophages (that was the correct spelling. Paddy could become scary when someone called them haemos in front of her), and always had a full agenda of meetings and media appointments.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai smirked at the thought of those three social disasters. Cyphr, the snake who would sting everyone like a scorpion with surgical precision as soon as they got on her bad side. Lejl, the horny gremlin that had all traits of an alpha wolf, but melt like butter when someone she liked complimented her, or simply hugged her, or touched her in the right spot. Paddy, a biologist who thought it would be a brilliant idea to film herself getting boned by a hemato – a video which was totally, positively not leaked on the net – had a pet phage cub, and, when distressed, started reciting all known facts about phages, even while having sex. That last part had been extremely amusing to Chai. Having a girl reach her climax while spouting the exact number of remaining phage clusters in the Dead Zone and their density distribution was something one had to be there and witness in real time to appreciate. That one made Chai still chuckle, as it happened the first time Paddy and she had shared one bed, live on stream.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">That was indeed an odd pattern, though – all the three people she had managed to open up to as of recent had no less than a one-night-stand with her. Maybe it was a rite of passage of sorts, maybe just a result of her weird upbringing, but she just couldn’t resist the chance to enter into carnal contact with the girls and boys she liked. In the back of her mind, she was convinced that people could be really understood only at their most vulnerable. The way she acted was probably just an extension of that concept. Still, sharing her secret with Cyphr had been easy, even before that one time they got intimate. She was a Crossbones in spirit, even if not in name, and Ange had guaranteed for her. Cyphr had been the first outsider she could openly speak with, even if their contacts had been quite sporadic. Lejl was a completely different can of worms. That little blond goblin had more secrets than her, and wasn’t really ready to share them. Chai had done her research to learn more about her elusive friend, but hers looked like a blank slate of sorts. No social network presence, no photos, no official school records from anywhere in the world, all her pictures were matched almost 99% by another person, a certain Aylin Mary Yang, to which Lejl was an almost exact copy – except for her eyes and tattoos – as if they were long lost twins. Lejl Kaleidos was a real phantom, with an aura of mystery glowing around her, those ever-inquisitive eyes, those dumb questions about how to behave near people. Sometimes, Chai had asked herself if Lejl was human in the first place, and not some weird Zavira android in disguise. That doubt had been washed away after a fateful drunken threesome with her and her girlfriend, where she made sure to inspect her whole body to find traces of metal, wires or weird sensors. Surprisingly, Cyphr was more of a machine than her, but both their skins tasted real good. With Paddy, it had been a happy accident, mostly. After their mutual stream wrapped up, Chai’s blindfold had gotten stuck in a camera support, causing it to get ripped off. That prompted her to curse like a longshoreman and act with such a precise environmental awareness, including tilting her head away from Paddy as fast as possible, that it had been impossible to hide the fact that she was – indeed – not blind. After that, Paddy asked her if she could look at her eyes, which left her as stiff as a stockfish for twenty long minutes. Instead of disposing of her, as Ange would have liked to, Chai thought she could get one more person to join the ranks of her “knights”, the few trusted people knowing about her secret. Everything turned out good, in the end, though her weird automatism of oversharing facts about hematos when under pressure made her a little bit of a cute oddball.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Whatever the case, they had started hanging out all together, on a semi-regular basis. And, on one of those nights, her blindfold had fallen off. She was too drunk to put it on again, so she paralyzed her three friends on the spot, and decided to see what would have happened if she had never averted her gaze from one of them. Of course, she had chosen Lejl. She loved messing with that little critter, even though she could become scary, when she wanted to. So, twenty minutes go, Lejl comes out of her paralysis like the other two gals, and she keeps on staring at her – but nothing happens. In that moment, Chai had felt a sort of puzzling joy. Maybe, she thought, she could have removed that damn blindfold and see in colors, see the world without a filter, at least around her close friends. It was a short-lived feeling, though. Her joy halted to a grind when she remembered that she had indeed already paralyzed Lejl and Paddy at least once, also by mistake. The mere fact that their brains fell for it again meant that the immunity wasn’t lasting, just a speck of dust in the wind of time.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai sighed, pulled out a can of Frogga-Cola from her shopping bag, opened it, sipped it a little. She noticed a grid of new buildings in the corner of her eye, only some lights still shining. What would have been like to live in one of them? Living in a single room with bathroom inside Crossbones base had its advantages, like having to pay no rent or utility bills, but sometimes she wished she could get a flat on her own. As if Ange would have ever allowed it, too high of a risk of her exposing herself to the neighbors. After all, her supposed secret was already known by no less than four people outside of Ange’s control – the fourth one being Jenn Husler, who worked on and off with Crossbones and was considered reliable enough, though not completely. More people knowing could have been a huge problem.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She sipped a little bit more of her cola. The route was completely straight, no need to turn left or right. She could loosen up a little. There was nobody around that suburb of New Langdon, at least nobody who would care about her. It was like that with Red too – a lot of bystanders, but nobody who would really take notice of them, as they lived at the edge of society. She could almost relive those memories, more than ten years after they happened.</p>

</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Okay, you know what? I’m sellin’ you to North Korea, if you keep on pesterin’ me like that!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, that’s unfair, dad! You promised me! Two months ago!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Say it! Say <em>dad</em> one more time and I’ll shove you into a carton box, then send you to Timbuktu, one way!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It was a weird sight, for the sleepy commuters around the road. A man in his thirties, wearing a long, beige trench coat, unkempt red hair, and a weird bandanna, arguing with a little girl, half his size, wrapped in a cute pink dress and with her eyes shielded by rather comically oversized shades. The kid was stomping her feet on the ground, while the adult was massaging his own forehead, as if to contain a splitting headache.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“But, come on, you’re my <em>dad</em>! How in the rottin’ hell should I call you? Mr. Donner Misterkay? That name is so campy, <em>dad</em>!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... okay, okay, stop, Chai. It’s my fault, awright? Gotta buy you a new plushie. Just... stop making a scene.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Red growled. It had been just four months after his escape from Encorp and the gruesome end he reserved to that slimy worm LeJarme (that bitch Martens was apparently still alive. Oh, well, some unfinished business for later). His plan was simple. Sell Medusa, send Roger his share, buy a flat in the Caribbeans, change name and start a new life. Except he couldn’t. Jerediah “Red” Horowitz, the man who killed his father for money, the guy who unceremoniously blew heads off with point-blank shots, couldn’t sell an eight years old girl. It was both hilarious and unfunny at the same time.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">When he retrieved her from Roger’s van, she was a malnourished, dirty, anorexic brat with long brown hair that were probably never cut and a blindfold wrapping those precious eyes of hers. She wasn’t talking or doing anything, just standing silent, eating only when she was ordered to, even <em>soiling</em> only when she was told to. A miserable life, had she had. Usually, Red wouldn’t have cared. Sell her to Washington or Moscow and get settled for life, that was all he wanted. Yet, he didn’t want to, not yet. Maybe, it was a spark of human compassion, but he knew what it was – a precise calculation. The girl was in such a bad state that nobody would have believed him. Medusa never officially existed, and even state-actors would find his story rather crazy. He needed to take care of her for a while, make her more – let’s say, presentable. A question of days. Weeks, at most.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Or so he thought.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“But, and here you listen to me, little shit! If you lose it like the last one, I’ll never, <em>never</em> buy you a new toy. That goddamn bunny that fell into the river was so expensive, goddamn you!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Worth at least ten or twelve joints of weed, and she managed to have it fall from a bridge while she was staring at the ships moving under it, in awe. She had never seen ships, she had never seen running water, she had never seen the outside world. For her, everything was new. So, in a bout of excitement, she lost grip on poor Nunu and let him fall to his death by drowning. Her tears and cries were heard from the other side of the bridges, with her calling the name of her rabbit plushie repeatedly. Nunu was her first toy, the first thing someone ever gifted her. She was in absolute shambles, Red had to literally rip her fingers from the rail. He didn’t feel good for that, but what choices did he have, before someone called a bobby on them?</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">And now, two months later, there they were, in front of a toy store, looking at the prices. Red had shivered, thought it would have been easier to dive into the river and try to find what was left of the goddamn rabbit than buying a new one. That wasn’t what he had signed up for. Yet, seeing that little girl so excited at his words, jumping like a little critter, made him feel <em>something</em>. Whatever that was or it meant, he was feeling a slight warmth inside his heart. That runt that barely a hundred days before couldn’t even speak and had not even got a name, was now a totally different being. His mind raced back to Roger’s van, to the moment he picked her up, gazing at that pathetic excuse of a girl in a laboratory straitjacket. They were both sitting on the van’s back, with the girl sitting on Roger’s lap, still trying to understand why she was free to move. Red had decided that starting a conversation of any shape or form might have been beneficial, so he decided to begin with a very simple question.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“What’s your name?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... name?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yeah, your name. You have one, right?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“M... Medusa.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“No, no, <em>Medusa</em> is – is the name of the project. I asked for <em>your</em> name, little shit!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The girl had turned head towards him, then towards Roger, then towards him again, a blindfold still covering her eyes.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“M... Medusa?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Red had rolled his eyes, much to Roger’s delight.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Looks like you ain’t good with kiddos, Red.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Shut up! You deal with her, if you want, awright?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Roger had chuckled even more, adjusted his sunglasses, his Hawaiian shirt. He didn’t really care about fashion and that rendezvous on the van was never supposed to happen in the first place. Officially, Red had disappeared after the incursion at Encorp, before Crossbones could find him. In reality, Red and he had an agreement to sell the girl and make enough bucks to live like billionaires for the rest of their lives. Roger seemed too relaxed than needed, casually patting their guest’s head.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You kno’ what? We should rip that blindfold off, so little missy can see us.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“And paralyze us like idiots? You <em>know </em>how Medusa works, right?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“What if I gave her my dark glasses?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Sure, try, you do you, but if you get stiff, I’ll leave you here and run away with your van.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Roger laughed it off, took off his glasses, gently put his hands around the girl’s head.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oki-doki, missy. Keep your eyes shut a li’l bit longer, please!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Medusa nodded, while Roger unwrapped the fabric shielding her eyes. Then, he put his sunglasses on her face. They were twice her size, but somehow covered her eyes well enough that her irises were completely darkened.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You can open them. C’mon! Open them!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The girl had gulped. The men in front of her were a strange bunch, more colorful than the scientists that handled her, but also more menacing. Yet, he could <em>see </em>their faces, could <em>watch</em> them, even if behind the lenses of dark sunglasses. Roger smiled.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“See, you miscreant? It work’d! I can move, see? Too dark for my brain to pick her patterns!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Okay, okay, I’ll give you that. You were r–right.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Red, then, stared again at the kid, which had fallen into a deep silence.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Let’s put things straight: name’s Red, but you’re gonna call me Donner, awright? This bozo here is Roger, and you...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">He looked back at Roger.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“How was it called, that shitty Indian tea Blazer drinks every morning? The one that gave him cancer?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... tea cannot cause cancer, Red.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Everything can cause cancer. This little shit here, for example, is causing me <em>ball cancer</em>. So, come on, how’s that tea friggin’ called?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I guess... masala chai? Black tea with spices and stuff. But I’m sure it didn’t cause...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Chai. Good.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Then, he stared back at the girl, pushed his index on her forehead.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“So, your name is Chai, got it? Not Medusa, not anything. Chai. Fine with you?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It had been <em>more</em> than fine with her. She loved that name. It was as if she was born again. Red thought back at that time. Why did he do that? Giving her a name meant acknowledging her as a human being, not a simple merchandise item he was going to sell. That had been his first mistake.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The first of a long series.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Truth was, he kind of <em>liked </em>having Chai around. She was learning a lot, and learning fast. Only four months in, and she had already become a new person. He didn’t know if to feel proud or worried about it. Nine year old girls weren’t his field of expertise. Blowing them up was.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I’m getting you a new Nunu, but no new shoes for a while, okay? These things are expensive as hell.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Red had brought her into the store, let her choose a new bunny plushie, paid with some dirty and ripped notes that were still deemed valid – something he considered a miracle – brought her out again. Her tiny arms were wrapped around the synthetic fur of the small stuffed animal, as if it was her most prized treasure.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Nunu... I’m not letting you die again. Chai will protect you, this time! And teach you how to swim!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You are <em>not </em>teaching him how to swim. Those things ain’t waterproof! If you really want to teach him something useful, teach him how to roll me some weed.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, I can already do that, dad! You don’t need Nunu to do that for you. Here!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She browsed a pocket in her dress, pulled out what looked like a small cigarette, gave it to Red. Red blinked twice at her, grabbed the unexpected gift from her hands. His eyes felt slightly water-y and wet, something that didn’t happen often. She did it for him. Chai, that little, whining, spoiled rotten kid, did it for him. The joint was masterfully crafted, not too long, not too short, not too large, not too thin, with the right amount of weed. Exactly how he taught her. A sliver of warmth breached through his stone-cold heart again. Then, he patted her on the head, as gently as he could.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You’re a good girl Chai.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It was small things like these that reminded him why he didn’t get rid of her as soon as he could. And, somehow, thought it could be nice if things could go on like that. Without a penny. Having to make ends meet. Yet, somehow... happy? Red shook his head, broke into a bout of maniacal laughter.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Dad?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I’m fine, I’m fine. Don’t worry, ’kay? Play a bit with Nunu, we still need to find a cheap supermarket to get somethin’ to eat. That Molco had a good Asian take-away by-the-pound, hadn’t it? You like Asian, I hope.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I love it! Spring rolls?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Hell damn, we’ll take at least one each.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">He knew it couldn’t last. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t make the best of the little time they could share together.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The familiar sight of Crossbones HQ brought Chai back from memory lane. The building was pretty inconspicuous, seen from outside: a large, three-floor condo with small square windows, mostly painted in gray, with a backside garden and a couple antennas at the top. There was a garage too on the side, hosting something between four and six vehicles. Crossbones didn’t really need a lot of space, as its members didn’t usually live inside the headquarters. Chai was an exception, together with probably no more than five or six other mercenaries. Ange himself owned a small flat at the outskirts of New Langdon and was living there alone, so, more often than not, he was nowhere to be seen during the evening. During vacation period, it was usually even lonelier, as the base only hosted a skeleton crew (no pun intended) of three guards and the number of fixed residents went down to just one or two people. Overall, that played really well for Chai – the only reason why she was allowed to perform as an erotic streamer in the first place was because nobody was there to complain about the noise. Sure, later during her career, she actively insulated her record room, but originally she didn’t have that luxury. It had been a pain to synchronize her schedule with the nights nobody was around in her wing of the building, but, somehow, it had paid off. To think it all started as a sort of idiotic bet with uncle Roger – because <em>of course </em>it had started as an idiotic bet. Three years after that first, awkward stream, she was making almost one third of her monthly income out of her side gig, giving her more than enough disposable money. Enough to live on her own, if that bonehead would ever let her do that in the first place.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She reached for the handle, her fingertips touching the scanner. Green light, door unlocked. Chai stepped inside the lobby, closed the door behind her, folded her cane. Inside there, she could stop pretending not to see. The guard for the night shift was already there, wearing an improbable Crossbones outfit. Chai greeted him.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, Ryan. Wassup?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The man called Ryan shrugged, his skull mask covering his face, making it impossible for her to gauge his expression.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Nothin’ fancy. Kind of tired. I’m already at my third coffee.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“It’s just ten.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Yeah, that might be an issue. But... huh, I’ll keep my eyes open. Seriously.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, you’ll better, or Ange will kick you in the nuts till you sing as a soprano.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Ryan shivered, brought his hand down to instinctively protect his family jewels.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Thanks for ruining my night, Chai. As usual.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“My pleasure.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai playfully gave him the raspberry, then waved her hand again. She took the flight of stairs to the right, with mechanical precision, then started walking down the corridor. She did it so often that it became pure routine and she didn’t even have to focus. Her body just moved automatically.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Yet, something was different.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Wrong.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">There was light.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Coming out of her apartment, slipping through under the door, like a little thief. She stopped in her tracks. She was dead sure she had switched off everything when she left. Everything. The door, too, was a little ajar.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Someone was inside.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai left the bag with the groceries on the ground, her hand went down her trousers, taking out the small concealed knife she kept attached to her thigh at all times. She brought her free hand to her nose, removed the blindfold, opened her eyes. Without the black silk partially blinding her view, the light spilling out of her room was even more evident. Chai fell silent. Whoever was in, they had eluded Ryan. Most likely, he was sleeping like the idiot he was. But, if that wasn’t the case, it had to be someone with access to her credentials. She breathed slowly. Only two chances. Either the person (or persons) inside had clearance to enter, and thus knew about her eyes, or they were outsiders, thus didn’t know about her eyes. But that wasn’t going to matter, since she was going to kill them before they could spill the beans. She silently stepped forward, as light-footed as she could, trying to make no noise. One meter to the door, her eyes wide open, her knife ready to strike, took one last breath.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Then, she grabbed the handle, opened it, rammed inside the room, her eyes wide open, her knife raised above her head.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Happy birthday, Chai!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She blinked. Twice. In rapid succession.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">In front of her, three people. Three girls, all around her age. A tall one, with delicate, ceramic prosthetic arms, wearing a pullover and jeans. A short one, with tattoos all over her body, wrapped in a leather jacket, a weirdly cut top and orange trousers. And one in between, with a long red braid and freckles, wearing a t-shirt and green trousers, having a sort of lizard resting on her shoulder. All of them wearing dark sunglasses.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, little Chai, happy birthday to...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, oi, OI! Time out. TIME. OUT.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai blinked again. And again. Her knife was still high above her head ready to fall on her prey. Except there was no prey. Only three social disasters holding a cake in front of her, while smiling, dancing and singing together. And wearing sunglasses. At night. In her room. Chai breathed heavily. Once. Twice. Those idiots. Those idiots were almost going to <em>die</em>, for their little reckless performance. Her heart was pumping, the adrenaline still moving through her body as a breakneck pace. Those morons. Those absolute fuckin’ morons. All smiling, those stupid smiles painted on their even stupider faces. Chai’s mind was crossed by slightly homicidal thoughts. She would have liked to kick all three of them in the ass, down the stairs, then bring them back up and kick them down again. Several times. Her heartbeat had started to relax, finally.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">There was no enemy.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Only three idiots.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“First. What the hell? Second. How? Third. WHY?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Her voice became progressively louder, as she couldn’t stare away from those three absolute units, standing in front of her on her carpet, near her bed and her table, meters away from her streaming equipment and her array of sex toys, holding a <em>birthday cake</em>. The first to talk was Cyphr, still giggling, while towering over every other girl in the room.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Juuust wanted to organize a small surprise for your birthday! I asked Ange for an access card, and...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... oi, you absolute tool, today is <em>not </em>my birthday!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Paddy and Lejl started laughing. Chai looked at them slightly puzzled, annoyed too.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... what’s so funny? Care to share?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Well, since you’ve never told us the date of your real birthday, we decided to celebrate it on a random day!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She inhaled deeply. That was... even more absurd than she cared to expect from them.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You know that this doesn’t make any sense, right?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cyphr pushed her glasses against her nose, smiled again.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Okay, okay, you’re right. The truth is, that the gift we wanted to give you took quite some time to get made and we didn’t want to wait for Christmas.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... the gift?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Lejl stepped forward, holding a small silver box in her hands. She placed it in Chai’s open palms, cracking a complicit smile.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“C’mon, open it! It’s all yours!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai sighed. Whatever, at that point it wasn’t even worth it to get angry at them. At least, they had the decency to wait for a day where she didn’t stream to pay her that surprise visit. She carefully unsealed the box, unlocked it, opened it. To her surprise, a pair of transparent lenses peeked out of the red velvet. She stared at them, puzzled.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Thaaaanks, I... huh, guess? What I’m supposed to do with them? Oi, you know that my sight is 20/10 and that I don’t even need glasses, right?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Paddy raised her finger, words pouring out of her lips like a torrent.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“That’s amazing! You know, hematophages have a natural sight that pales in comparison to that of the average of human beings and would be equivalent to only around 20/50! This is exacerbated in noctiphages, which are completely blind! So, while it isn’t out of the ordinary for you to see better than...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai pinched her lips, shutting them in the process.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Thanks, Paddy. Not now. And, not to sound like a broken record, but what am I supposed to do with contact lenses?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cyphr clapped her ceramic hands.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Act first, ask questions later! Just wear them, <em>du nervensäge</em>!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Paddy nodded too, trying to stop her urges to share other facts about phages in the process.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Y... yes, trust us!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai looked at them with a hint of suspicion, squared all three of their faces, one after another.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, know that if this is a prank, I’ll rip those sunglasses, paralyze you, and kick your darn asses, over and over till you pass out.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She mumbled those words with a hint of annoyance, not sure if she really meant them or not. As far as her memories could go, those three little sunshine sparks had never joked around her condition. Whatever prank they pulled on her, they had always been tasteful, in some shape or form. Joking on her eyes wasn’t something they would have done lightly. She moved to her bathroom, stood in front of the mirror. She wore the first lens, then the second. Closed her eyes, opened them again. They weren’t uncomfortable at all, which surprised her greatly. Yet, she could see no difference. Her sight was still the same. Her eyes were still the same, maybe just a little bit dimmer. She didn’t know how to elaborate on it, but she was just glad that her brain couldn’t be paralyzed by her own reflection. That would have been an even stupider feature for a bioweapon – even if in tune with the original myth behind her namesake. She sighed. Whatever those three blockheads had in mind, had to be part of some elaborate ruse.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Have you worn them?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oi, I have. Now?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Come back here!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai sighed. Those three unpredictable morons were the bane of her existence, at times like those. She went back to the room, with annoyance painted all over her face. Then, she saw them. And almost had a stroke.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“OI! You idiots! What the...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">They had <em>removed their glasses</em>.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">They were <em>staring directly at her</em>.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She averted her gaze immediately, closed her eyes, silently praying not to have paralyzed any of them. She cursed under her breath, cursed her “power”, the source of all her woes since she was a kid. She stood like that for a second, trying not to think about the consequences of that reckless gesture. Then, she heard it.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY"><em>Laughter</em>. Genuine laughter.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Chai, there’s no need to behave like that, really!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Open those shining eyes of yours, princess!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai turned reluctantly, still keeping her eyes closed.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“But what... what if...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Come on, <em>du dummkopf</em>! We told you to trust us, or?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai wasn’t convinced, not at all. Last time she trusted them to act as responsible adults, they ended up in bed together. Which wasn’t a problem per se, but it starts becoming an issue when you want to keep your distance and have some normal friends (for any suitable definition of normal), instead of being all about the benefits. Yet, she decided to humor them. She slowly opened her lids, peeking through her eyelashes, noticing that none of them wore glasses. She instinctively shut her eyes close almost immediately.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I can’t. I... this is stupid. This is so stupid...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Then, she felt them, Cyphr’s ceramic hands wrapped around hers, almost trying to reassure her, her voice whispering in her ears.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Open your eyes, Chai. Please.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She sighed, took a deep breath, started opening them again, forced herself to overcome her instincts. Her eyes wide open, her irises shining through the lenses. Her three friends watching her, cheering her. She stood still for a moment, incapable of processing that scene.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She was staring at them, she was staring at their eyes. But they were still moving.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She was seeing as well as she could while not wearing her blindfold, and, despite that, her powers were not kicking in. She fell silent, touched her eyes. She could feel the thin artificial surface separating them from the world, yet she couldn’t <em>see </em>it. It was like not wearing anything, like looking around with naked eyes. The colors. The shapes. Everything matched. Not that dark, blurry world she was accustomed to see from behind her glasses, behind her blindfold. The real world, as if she wasn’t different. As if her eyes weren’t weapons that paralyzed every human being staring at them.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“W... wh...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Happy birthday, Chai. For real.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She blinked twice, touched her eyes again, moved forward, nearer to Cyphr, to Lejl, to Paddy, gazed at them, at their beautiful, colorful irises. While they kept moving. They kept laughing. They kept hugging her. Cyphr patted her hair, while looking directly into her eyes.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“An old acquaintance of Ange is an expert in nano-optics. Jacques Caller, or Jakall – you know how Ange’s friends tend to be as theatrical as him with nicknames. Well, point is, we had the idea of giving him a visual scan of your irises, with which he managed to build those lenses. They just... filter your vision a bit – not enough to disrupt it, but long enough that it averages your rapidly oscillating patterns... making them harmless.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai couldn’t believe those words. <em>Harmless.</em> Her eyes. <em>Not a weapon</em>. She looked at the three of them again, failing to keep her emotions in check.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“O... oi, you aren’t... you aren’t pulling a prank on me, r... right? This... this isn’t a j... joke, right? Right?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">They shook their head, one after another. She tried to keep her emotions in check, to keep her bravado, her usual cool demeanor. But she couldn’t. Just one minute before, she was thinking about how stupid her friends were. One minute later, she was crying like a fountain, crying tears of joy, hugging all of them.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">For the first time in twenty-three years, she felt she had a chance.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">A chance at living a normal life.</p>

</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">It was not unusual for <em>Jackson’s</em> to be open that late at night. Its faceless owner closed shop only as soon as the clock struck twelve, two or three times per week. What was unusual, was seeing Cyphr hanging out with three other girls. Cyphr, the reclusive, stubborn, tomboy that until not even two years before was in her rebellious alone-time teen phase, and now was drinking and eating together with <em>friends </em>(including her even more chaotic girlfriend). Jackson wasn’t even sure where she found them, either. Admittedly, he had grown accustomed to seeing Lejl, much less to interacting with her. Every time they had a conversation, it felt like reading a book about the unknown. For every question answered, two more mysteries surfaced. She was identical to Amy, aside from those amber eyes. Her voice was the same too. What was different, was her full body tattoos and her completely unpredictable behavior. Amy was very polite and always careful with words. Lejl was direct but always skirting the line between piercing, precise observations and totally out-of-left-field remarks.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Jackson liked her, he thought she completed Cyphr perfectly – yet, he would have loved to know something more about her origins. Shaz and he had a running bet about it. Shaz put his (scarce) money on a lab-grown, clone-in-a-vat of Amy, who escaped containment and found refuge in Cyphr’s house. Jackson had decided to go with the classic “extraterrestrial-engineered pod person”, who was going to replace Amy, but fell for Cyphr and abandoned her conquest plans. Whatever the version, Cyphr saved the world from her. By being laid by her (or the opposite. Jackson suspected Cyphr to be the top of the couple, a sentiment somehow shared by his finned friend too).</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">That night, Cyphr wasn’t there alone with Lejl, though. There were two other people, and both of them spelled <em>trouble</em>. He squinted his eyes, hoping to be wrong, while casually cleaning some beer glasses. One of the two had red hair styled in a long braid... and a sort of red lizard with a ribbon, placidly resting on her shoulder. She looked a lot like that weirdo biologist that wrote a book about mating with haemophages, and probably was <em>exactly</em> her – which put her firmly in the “stranger than Lejl” basket. The fourth member of the quartet was another one of those faces whom Jackson had a vague recollection of. He remembered having seen her with Ange and Jenn a couple times already, but she always wore glasses or what looked like a blindfold. This time, thought, it was different. She was looking around with her bare, colorful irises, starry-eyed and dripping with happiness like a kid going to an amusement park. He considered casually strolling by and eavesdropping their conversations, but he knew better than many others how curiosity had killed a metric ton of cats. Thus, he went back to his chores, making a mental note of asking Cyphr later about it.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">At the table, Chai was enjoying every second of that experience. Colors, colors as she had seldom seen them, not screened by the black velvet, by those dark lenses. Colors, as they were <em>meant</em> to be seen. She started sobbing, and crying, and sobbing again at regular interval. That was the most beautiful moment in a long time. Watching around as if she was normal, allowing people to stare in her eyes without having to kill them, without having to pretend to be blind.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She wiped the tears once again, promising to herself that there wouldn’t have been another time. A promise she wasn’t sure how to keep.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“O... oi, gals, I’m... I’m sorry. I... I don’t know what’s getting into me.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The only answer she got, was a parade of bright smiles. They were radiant, all three of them, They were <em>happy for her</em>. She had to stop herself from bursting once more into tears. Those blockheads. Those blockheads made her the best gift she had ever received in her adult life. And yet, they were sitting there, as if nothing had happened. Cyphr patted her head, her ceramic hands tapping lightly on her brown strands.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“It’s fine, Chai. We had an occasion and decided to seize it!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“B... but it probably cost a lot! And you three... oh, wait.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She turned towards Paddy, squared her, pushed her finger on her lips.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You are currently shittin’ money, right? You paid for them?!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Paddy chuckled, moved her finger away.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You have no idea of how much cash you can get by being invited on TV to talk about the size of a hemato’s dick and how it felt touching it! But, no, seriously I don’t have <em>that</em> much disposable income. Cyphr put a sizable contribution too. And Lejl is excused, I’d say, since...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Lejl rolled her eyes, pinched Paddy’s cheek before she could finish her sentence, her voice becoming so loud to overshadow the jazz music from the jukebox.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Stop it! I’m <em>applying </em>for jobs, seriously! But I’m not getting any interviews, every time I show up in person, they just pass on me! God, I hate being unemployed!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cyphr punched her lightly on the shoulder, sneering at her, knowing full well she would get annoyed by that.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You should spend some bucks on a new suit, Lalli! You can’t go there dressed like... you usually do and expect them to hire you!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Oh, yeah, you say that <em>now</em>, but then you <em>beg </em>me to wear revealing stuff, when it’s just the two of us, Cyphy. Choose one, either new transparent dresses for our private moments – which you seem to like a lot – or a new suit for job searching!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cyphr turned red, her cheeks lighting up like traffic lights. Lejl was also red in her face, but mostly out of anger. Losing her job had been a nightmare for her. Fortunately, she had a roof over her head, as she was living together with Cyphr, but not having any income made her feel like a parasite. And it was all his fault, Mr. Kissilmer’s fault, the fault of the utter chaos surrounding his unexpected, gruesome disappearance, if so could be called. It all happened all of a sudden, not even three days after she met Paddy for the first time at the flower shop, a flower shop that was now shut down for good, never to open again. Which meant that Lejl was officially jobless. And that she had an adult noctiphage to take care of, too.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">The only saving grace of all that ruckus was that she got to know Paddy better, learned about her exploits with both hematos and their common acquaintance, and finally welcomed her among the close circle of her and Cyphr’s friends. Still, her situation was less than ideal and she was fully, painfully aware of it.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I can’t believe I’ve worked for a zombie for that long. But come on, he paid well! And always on time!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“My salary is still more than enough, for now, but...”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Cyphy, I’m not asking you to pay for me <em>again</em>. It’s a question of principle.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Paddy looked at them, looked at Chai again, brushed her own hair, wearing a tired smile.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... well, so, to summarize: Cyphr had the idea, Ange put us in touch with Jakall, and we paid him for making them, without giving out too many details about your story. I <em>think </em>he was familiar with your adoptive father as he said – and I quote <em>“since when that patricide bastard son of a whore had a daughter?”</em>”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai chuckled. That... wasn’t inaccurate. That Jakall had to be familiar with Red, in one way or another. She realized she was staring at her friend, staring at her deep emerald eyes, finally able to admire them without shutting her entire motor system down. She started noticing details and patterns in her freckles, the intricate ways her unruly hair were tamed at the side of her face, moving around her ears. All those little details she was denied, finally surfacing. Chai felt her heart aching. She could have tried to think about it sooner. She could have evaded her blind cage before. Yet...</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... if you are really <em>that</em> desperate for a job, I’m currently looking for a waitress. As long as you respect the dress code, I’m confident <em>not even you </em>could manage to screw that up.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">An unfamiliar voice shook her out of her trance. Vince Jackson. The owner of the place, in blurry face and yellow fedora. Standing right near their table. Pointing his finger at Lejl. Who was looking back at him dumbfounded.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... are you for real? Me? A waitress at <em>Jackson’s</em>?!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You’re used to work night shifts, correct me if I’m wrong.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“No, no, you are right. But how does that help?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Jackson tipped his hat, while pacing around the table back and forth.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I want to try out a new schedule, with opening hours till four in the morning, but it’s hard to find motivated personnel for that. So, that’s my offer: four nights per week, six hours per night. Good starting salary, plus all tips you can get, if any.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Lejl started doing some mental math, her eyes closed to focus.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“That... sounds good, but I need some time to think about it. Can I give you an answer next week?”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Fine with me. Now, you’ll excuse me, but I need to go back to the counter. Even without that dumb shark getting drunk every evening, this place seems to be a magnet for weirdos.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">With those words, Jackson strolled away, while some of his waiters were gesturing in his direction, frantically pointing towards the bathroom. The four of them looked at him go, until finally snapping out and going back to staring at each other. With Chai <em>forcing</em> herself to <em>not</em> avoid eye contact. It was hard to fight her muscle memory, habits accrued in more than ten years. She was struggling to let them go, but she was making a conscious effort to.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cyphr was giggling, her eyes were sparking, her black databands covered in partying face emojis (Lejl had switched that function on again the previous night, unbeknownst to her, and she had not noticed yet).</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“You have a job offer, Lalli! That’s wonderful!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... from a zombie scarecrow to a faceless dude. What a greeeat step forward in choice of employer, huh? Yeah, it sounds good, but that means I’ll have less time to spend with you, unless you folks decide to hang out here in the dead of night.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“I’m excited to see you behind that counter, wearing that white shirt, elegant trousers, leather shoes and suspenders! I’m sure you’ll look dashing! But you should at least have something underneath, otherwise... aaaaah, I can’t think straight!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“... is it the only reason why you want me to take this job? Because you’d like to stare at my nipples peeking out under a white shirt while drinking a cocktail in this crusty cafe?!”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Cyphr blushed, realizing the implications of her impromptu comments, at which both Chai and Paddy started shaking their respective heads.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“And they say <em>I’m</em> the horny one.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">“Don’t tell me.”</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">They both laughed maniacally, while Cyphr was shrinking on her seat, trying her best to hide her embarrassment, but causing it to stand out even more in the process. Chai found her cute, when her tough girl persona crumbled under pressure. Cyphr usually acted way more mature than her age, usually being the only sane voice of reason (maybe together with Paddy, but she was a genius PhD, so it didn’t count) but she was actually the youngest among them. Those rare moments where her naivete surfaced were an absolute treasure. And, in a way, now she felt she understood her even better. Both had a handicap since childhood. Both stubbornly refused to find a solution, until the solution presented itself. And none of them would have gone back to how things were before. Cyphr would have never renounced to her prosthetic arms willingly. And Chai felt, not even after one hour of wearing them, that she couldn’t, she wouldn’t want to stop using those lenses. It had been as if a veil had been pierced, as if she only then managed to learn how to live.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">She stared outside the window, peeking at the empty streets, at the flickering lampposts. She wondered how would the world have looked the morning after, the day after, with all the colors of the dawn, of the sunlight, of the twilight, how it would have felt without a filter. How it would have felt without that artificial limitation. Martens and LeJarme were dead and buried. Whoever was in the know for the Medusa Project was six feet under, except for the CEO of Encorp, but he didn’t even seem to care much about it and wasn’t privy to the details. There was no reason to act blind anymore, if she didn’t have to. No reason.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Well, maybe her online subs would plummet once she told her raving fans on Booner that <em>she had an operation to her eyes</em> and she was finally able to see. Maybe, just maybe, she could have come straight with them, but still wear a real, 100% opaque blindfold during her streams only, just so their fantasies and her uniqueness in the ero streaming panorama could still hold. Yet, those were secondary concerns, compared to that inebriating sensation of freedom.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">Chai chuckled. It felt surreal. Exchanging stares with people without being worried about killing them. Doing ordinary stuff like drinking a hot chocolate in a cafe at the outskirts of New Langdon at eleven thirty in the night. Walking down the streets while being <em>allowed</em> to look around, to stop and enjoy a view without raising suspects. She felt born again. And, for a second, she hoped Red could be there to see her laughing, joking with those three other societal rejects, while wearing his dumb, weed-induced smile and gifting her a bunny plushie again, patting on her head with his rough hands. And, as she gazed at her friends, she realized that her story was just at the beginning.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">That after a long existence in the dark, there was still place for a thread of light.</p>
