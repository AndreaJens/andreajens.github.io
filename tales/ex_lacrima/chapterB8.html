<h1>Ex Lacrima Remnant</h1>
<h2 class="western" lang="en-US"><a name="_Toc"></a> #B-Side<span lang="en-US"> VIII &ndash; Storytime</span></h2>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Let me tell you a story.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Once upon a time, there was a starry-eyed girl. The girl was rebellious and immature, but strongly believed in justice and decided to became a protector of the weak. One day, this girl met another girl, one that resembled a plant, and found herself enraptured by her ethereal beauty. That vision changed her forever, made her eyes even starrier, brighter, as she dreamed of a future where she could kiss that plant girl and live happy ever after with her. But the plant people weren&rsquo;t free. They were treated as property, as things. Which made the girl sad and, ultimately, forced her to accept the status quo and give up on her dreams.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">However, the girl couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it. She would often be found gushing in secret about her plant crush, even around other plants &ndash; including her hero, the one who led her in her battle against evil. But her hero, who listened and listened and listened, began to resent her. To resent her starry-eyedness. To resent her lack of will to change. To resent her idea that plant girl owed her her affection.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Maybe, the hero was just jealous of her innocence.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Maybe, she was just fed up with her gushing.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Or, maybe, she wanted to be the one she so gushed about.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">And those feelings bottled up, churning and condensing as dark clouds looming over them.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">One unfortunate day, though, because of an equally unfortunate accident, the starry-eyed girl lost her sight. Her eyes shone no more. Her light dimmed and died. A shell of her former self, without a future. Yet, still clinging to her innocence, to her dream. Her last anchor of sanity.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">That&rsquo;s when her hero turned on her too.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Why? Hard to say.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Maybe, those bottled up feelings found a way out.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Maybe, that girl had become the symbol of all what the hero hated about humans.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Or, maybe, the hero simply reveled in the idea of being able to decide the fate of one human.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Instead of a human deciding her fate.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">As always.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY"><span lang="en-US">So, the hero took action and destroyed everything the starry-eyed girl held dear, before destroying her too. Yet, in a last moment, the hero decided to spare the unfortunate girl&rsquo;s life, gifting her an elixir instead. In turn, </span>the now blind girl was exiled to the dark lands, never to come back.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Why? Hard to say.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">But she did have a change of heart, albeit barely.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">And the girl survived, albeit barely.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">In a form far from that of a guardian of justice. A form more befitting a villain. A villain who lost all of her innocence. A villain who devoured the starry-eyed girl, taking over her broken body and mind. Now fighting against the hero that inspired her in the first place.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">The end.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Oh, you didn&rsquo;t like it? Too abrupt? No resolution? I agree, I don&rsquo;t like it either, but that&rsquo;s the thing &ndash; stories like this aren&rsquo;t meant to be liked. They are meant to teach a lesson.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">What this lesson is, though, is not for me to explain.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">And keep them for yourself.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Because, you see&hellip; heroes don&rsquo;t need to be understood.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">They only need to carry out their justice.</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="JUSTIFY">Even when said justice goes against the accepted norms.</p>
