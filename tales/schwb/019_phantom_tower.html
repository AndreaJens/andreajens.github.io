    <p><em>July 2064. On the run from the Fishface Syndicate, Shaz seeks refuge in the so-called Witch Tower of New Langdon, now infamous due to the urban legend of The Man With the Hat. Yet, with no other places to go, Shaz sees no alternatives to seeking shelter inside the dilapidated building...</em></p>

<hr>
<p class="western">The fortress was imposing. Layers over layers of jagged stone bricks, sculpted with precision and enough variance to give the impression of looking at a castle of old, in all its century-long ruined glory. Except it wasn’t even thirty years old. Just the doing of an eccentric Austrian nobleman, who had decided to commission several towers around the world, gifting it to the cities he had lived in during his youth.</p>

<p class="western">
  <em>That fella sure had an inordinate amount of money and didn’t know how to spend it, huh.</em>
</p>

<p class="western">He sighed.</p>

<p class="western">Money. Exactly what the root cause of his problems was. Money. Or, more precisely, the lack thereof. He stared again at the monumental opening, the battlements at the top, the majestic arcs, the narrow windows. In usual circumstances, he wouldn’t have given a damn about them – he wasn’t one for appreciating architectural masterpieces. Yet, he felt a chill down his spine. That place was enveloped by a bizarre aura. Be it for the sudden death of its owner barely six months before or for the concerning rumors around it, he felt as if he wasn’t wanted there. He stepped forward nonetheless. It was late, way past midnight. And he was tired. Dead tired.</p>

<p class="western">Running away from his flat, barely evading gunfire from people he had called brothers not even one year before... all of that had taken a toll on his health. He just wanted to rest, possibly without being Swiss cheesed by a Sachson machine gun. And that place, that abandoned place, looked like a quiet venue to have some shuteye. Feliz would have never thought of looking for him there. Blade? Blade maybe, but he wouldn’t have snitched. There was still something between them. There had been something between them. He shook his head. Wishful thinking? The memories of his big, warm arms hugging him, the memories of his kisses, of those shining, green eyes that made his heart race... just memories. Moments to be forgotten. He was an outcast now, and by his own choice.</p>

<p class="western">He gazed at the stone complex once more. There were lots of urban legends about the place. Legends of ghosts haunting it. Of the spirits of the dead whispering in the ears of children to have them run away from home, never to be found again. And in the ears of adults, making them believe jumping from the tall tower was their only choice forward. He didn’t believe them. He didn’t believe in ghosts, let alone haunted places. However, recently there had been other kinds of rumors – rumors of a person lurking inside that old-looking building.</p>

<p class="western">An entity simply referred as “the man with the hat” or “blurry face”.</p>

<p class="western">It was indeed a weird story that spread like wildfire in the underworld of New Langdon. You bring a suitcase full of bills, write your request on an A5 piece of paper (not bigger, not smaller) and leave it in front of the Witch Tower. If you are lucky, your suitcase disappears and the man with the hat fixes your issue for you. That witness will refrain from talking. That traitorous goon will disappear in the middle of the night. Those stolen goods you’ve thrown into the river will be back to your house. That car that compromises your alibi will disappear from existence. And the one thing you’ll notice is a glimpse, a spot of color in the corner of your eye. Nothing more. Some believed it. Some even brought loads of cash to the tower, waiting for it to be snatched. Some tried to film it. Yet, nothing ever happened, when the cameras were up. But, sometimes, the suitcases would just disappear without apparent reason. And no goons would go the easy, straightforward way of just entering the building to look for him themselves. Or rather, not openly. There were tales of city clerks going through the tower to search for any signs of this phantom’s existence, but none seemed to have reported anything strange or out of the ordinary.</p>

<p class="western">
  <em>Someone must be playin’ on this dumbass hearsay.</em>
</p>

<p class="western">He thought it was stupid. The man with the hat had to be a creature born out of the hallucinating mind of a junkie doing drugs near the tower. All reports about this fairytalish serial badass problem-solver were recounts from friends of friends, distant relatives, father’s brother’s nephew’s cousin’s former roommates, and so on and so forth. And, if that man really existed, too bad for him – he wasn’t going to change his sleeping plans because of a hypothetical colorful hatted dandy.</p>

<p class="western">The pale moon was shining from the clouds above, dimly illuminating the stone structure. He could see a small, side door. Open. Against all the odds.</p>

<p class="western">He shrugged.</p>

<p class="western">
  <em>Better not to have it wait.</em>
</p>

<p class="western">He reached for it, a small bag in hand, all his remaining belongings. Shades. A picture of Blade and him. Two old golden guns, now useless without bullets. Seven ID documents with seven different names – Shaz, Gaetano, Chazz, Evaristo, Fidel, and two more he couldn’t remember. A burner phone. A flashlight. The rests of a half-eaten sandwich. More, he couldn’t save. He wouldn’t even want to. Thus, he stepped through the stone arch, entering the darkness of the tower.</p>

<p class="western">Silence welcomed him, the clacking echo of his steps on the naked stone as his only companion. The man (or sharkman?) called Shaz, Gaetano or any of his fake identities proceeded slowly, up the stairs, in the coldness of the night, paying attention at where he was putting his feet. No light to brighten his path. No music to alleviate his pain. The hooting of an owl in the distance broke through the barren walls, reverberating in the corridors. He ignored it, went forward. There had to be a room to rest, somewhere inside that tower. He wasn’t expecting to find a bed, or even a bed frame at all, but looking for it didn’t hurt. He turned his flashlight on, once he became confident nobody could see him from the outside, shone it on the walls. Rows of paintings, everywhere, many of which portraying a bat, or a person with a large bat-shaped helmet. Some of the scenes portrayed were kind of disconcerting, such as the one with a giant bat devouring an eagle after killing it, all rendered with a magnificently grotesque style. The man behind the towers had to love bats, that was sure. Yet, the city of New Langdon, to which said tower was gifted, probably didn’t, and definitely didn’t know what to do with the once magnificent building, now defaced and full of graffiti not even one year after its creator died.</p>

<p class="western">Suddenly, the beam flickered. Once. Twice. Low battery. He cursed. That wasn’t a good omen. No spares meant no light. He hoped to find a place to sleep soon, before the remaining strength of his dying companion expired. Then, he saw it. A door.</p>

<p class="western">He looked at it, reached for it, slowly, trying to make as little noise as possible, touched the handle with care. His heartbeat pumped, deafened his ears. Then, he gathered his courage, pulled the handle. The hinges creaked in a prolonged lament, as the door made way for him. And, in front of his eyes, a small, cramped room with no windows made its appearance.</p>

<p class="western">It wasn’t well furnished, but he could make out the shape of a table, a chair with a broken leg, and what looked like a mattress. A bowl with some fresh fruits, a bottle of water, a deck of cards. Random objects left around, without any connection he could appreciate. Maybe it was some homeless sod’s shelter. He looked around again. Nobody in sight. The cards on the table were arranged in a half finished solitaire, with one card put on the wrong staple too. The fruits looked fresh, but the same couldn’t be said for the water in the bottle. He calmed down.</p>

<p class="western">
  <em>Whatever, I ain’t picky. Aaaand there ain’t nobody home.</em>
</p>

<p class="western">He touched the mattress. It seemed fine, relatively new too. Yet, no bed sheet was laid onto it. No frame was keeping it from being stranded on the stone floor. It didn’t look very comfortable, but – he reasoned – beggars on the run from the fishface mafia can’t be choosers.</p>

<p class="western">It was then that he noticed it.</p>

<p class="western">It was just a spot of color, in the corner of his eye, at the beginning. Something his brain just barely registered. In the dark, dimly lit by the beam of his flashlight, if only for an instant. Shaz glared at the door. It had to be an effect of self-suggestion. Yet...</p>

<p class="western">He gazed around, trying to pinpoint the origin of that unease, slowly stepped towards the open door, moving the beam from left to right, from up to down.</p>

<p class="western">Then, he screamed.</p>

<p class="western">“Blooody moonfiiiiiish!”</p>

<p class="western">And ducked. And yelled. And screamed again. His flashlight was pointing towards it, towards a dark silhouette, a shadowy figure, standing not even two meters away.</p>

<p class="western">Dressed in something that looked like a suit, a <em>shocking pink</em> suit.</p>

<p class="western">The light flickered, as the figure closed in. Shaz shook his head, waved his arms, yelped like a dog. Then, his survival instinct kicked in, a wild idea shaped up in his mind. In that moment of terror and adrenaline, something he would have never considered doing in a normal situation became the focus of his thought.</p>

<p class="western">One second before, his flashlight was beaming at a weird man wearing strange colors, advancing menacingly. One second later, it was flying, spinning in the air, directed at said man’s head. And hitting it, with a loud thud.</p>

<p class="western">“Damn it! You bloody dumb absolute <em>idiot</em>!”</p>

<p class="western">A voice. A human voice. Yelling in pain. Something falling on the floor. A hat. A hat that was unmistakably of that same shocking pink color, as dimly lit by the spinning flashlight as it was, even only for a second. Shaz looked up at that cursing figure who was keeping a hand on his forehead, stepping towards him with what could be described as <em>blind rage</em>. He couldn’t make out the details of his face. It was too dark to see, and his flashlight was now lying, battered and switched off, on the stone floor. The only thing he could see was the suit, and the now hatless man wearing it. Terror turned into curiosity, which helped him calm down, if only a little bit.</p>

<p class="western">“I’m sorry! I’m sorry pal! I got surprised an’ didn’t know who ya were, and...”</p>

<p class="western">“And you threw a bloody flashlight at me?! <em>Seriously</em>?”</p>

<p class="western">The man reached for his fallen hat, put it back to its rightful place. Then, stared at the sorry mess in front of him. It was a sharkman. A sort of freak, like the big tiger guy in the nearby cell he used to occupy in Euterpe. Only, this one was no prisoner. He was a bona fide free-roaming <em>mutant</em>. And a stupid one, at it. He kept his gaze on him, as he was trying to stand up, still hypnotized in a sort of magnetic awe at the sight of his majestic presence. The man touched his eyebrow, or rather the ever-shifting flesh structure he had for an eyebrow, constantly moving between several different renditions of a bump. He hated that, but he had learned to accept it – somehow. That was him, his shape, his face... or faces. Not something he could get rid of, even if he wanted.</p>

<p class="western">“Didn’t you get the memo, imbecile? <em>Nobody</em> enters this tower. You want me to help you out? Leave the money on the stairs and get the bloody heck out!”</p>

<p class="western">Shaz blinked. Twice.</p>

<p class="western">Money. Help you. Tower. His brain slowly made the connection. He gasped.</p>

<p class="western">“Blooody moonfish! Ya’re blurry face?! The man with the hat?! You <em>EXIST</em>?”</p>

<p class="western">The man froze for a long instant, even forgetting to breath in the meanwhile, while his heart skipped a beat. Then, he spoke, his voice turning into a icy blade, piercing Shaz’s ears with its sharpness.</p>

<p class="western">“<em>Blurry face</em>?”</p>

<p class="western">With a sudden movement, he kicked the sharkman in his stomach. Shaz cried in pain, curled, his eyes wide open. The man grabbed his dorsal fin, lifted him up until he could stare at his terrorized pupils.</p>

<p class="western">“Listen up, you planktonbrain. First, you enter <em>my room</em> in the middle of the night. Then, you try to hit me with a bloody flashlight. Then, you have the guts to call me names, just like that? Do you have a death wish?”</p>

<p class="western">“I...”</p>

<p class="western">“My name is <em>not</em> blurry face. It’s Johnson. Johnson, get it? Now, get lost.”</p>

<p class="western">He let him go, let him fall again to the floor. Shaz bumped on the stone, managed to lift himself, sit down, started massaging his belly. That Johnson fellow hit him <em>hard</em>. He could feel his muscles aching, pain radiating from the point of impact. Yet, he felt strangely comfortable. Blurry face was no ghost. He could touch him. He could be wounded. He cursed like he would have. He was a human being, in flesh, blood and flashy colors. A weirdo, a societal outcast. Not too dissimilar from him. He sighed.</p>

<p class="western">“Aaalright, alright. Ain’t you got another room here?”</p>

<p class="western">The man called Johnson turned around, stared at him with homicidal intent. The sharkman couldn’t see him, couldn’t see his face in that unlit alley, couldn’t appreciate the lack of details – and probably wasn’t even asking himself questions about it. Ignorance was bliss, truly. Yet, that was really the definition of stretching his luck.</p>

<p class="western">“Didn’t I tell you to get lost?”</p>

<p class="western">“Yeah, ya did! But it’s either I sleep here oooor I sleep with the fish! ‘cause, not gonna lie, the mafia’s gotta kill me dead if they get their fins on me.”</p>

<p class="western">“What...?”</p>

<p class="western">Shaz stopped his words before they left his throat. He would have loved to say that he stole a couple million pounds from the vault. And that not one single pound was left. His former associates still believed he had the money stored somewhere, anywhere – hidden, maybe. Of course they’d think that, but that wasn’t the case. Shaz was broke, that fortune disappeared. But he couldn’t tell this to that man, to blurry face. He didn’t have a single friend he could talk with about it, and of course that man was no friend. He was a fixer, a problem-solver. Someone that could have been hired by don Go to get his hands on him and slice him like sushi.</p>

<p class="western">“... long story, pal. But Imma kind of an outcast, got it? Nowhere to run. Well, except one place, but I can’t go there this evenin’, see? That reptile ain’t gonna take it lightly.”</p>

<p class="western">And whoever tried to kill him would have surely tried to intercept him on the way in. Sure, Mr. Daevka might have helped him, but that old sneaky bastard wasn’t known for putting his life on the line for a mere acquaintance. Still, if he managed to endure the night, not even Go’s henchfish would dare execute him in broad daylight. Spending his night at <em>Le Coq Heureux</em> was his only sane option. Except, it wasn’t applicable at the moment.</p>

<p class="western">“Pleeeeeeeeease!”</p>

<p class="western">Johnson stared at him, from under his hat, his eyebrow still aching. The fishface mafia was an unwelcome customer. He couldn’t think of corrupting them as those simpleton city clerks that inspected the tower every other month and reported it as “perfectly empty”. Those cronies smelled the scent of paper bills and were content enough to let Johnson stay there in secret. From a certain point of view, he was paying his rent to the municipality – just in a very unorthodox way. Don Go’s fishmen weren’t inclined to be bought. Dealing with them could have potentially turned into a bloodbath. He looked again at the begging excuse of a shark, bowing in front of him with his hands joined. He could have solved the situation by knocking him out cold, wrapping him in a black trash bag, and delivering it to his kin, directly at their doorstep, with a nice greeting card taped on. That would have won him don Go’s favor, plus some additional contacts in the underworld. Carrying over missions and small tasks without ever talking to his customers meant he didn’t know for whom he was working, most of the times. He needed to do some networking, somehow. His odd jobs had given him a way to get by, but if he wanted to stay in the business, he had to enlarge his hunting ground – and do it soon.</p>

<p class="western">Yet, the more he looked at that pathetic excuse of an apex predator, the less he felt he could turn him in. He had not disposed of anybody yet, during his short life outside of the lab. Leading the shark to his death felt somehow... wrong.</p>

<p class="western">He sighed. He was going to regret his decision.</p>

<p class="western">“There’s another room down the corridor. No mattress or pillow, just bare stones. I keep my wardrobe there – and a couple bottles of water. You can take one, but touch <em>any </em>of my suits or <em>hats </em>and you are <em>dead</em>.”</p>

<p class="western">Shaz blinked in the shadows, his mouth agape, a sentiment of utter disbelief spreading like wildfire.</p>

<p class="western">“W... wait... this means I can stay?!”</p>

<p class="western">“Only until the sun rises, okay? I’ll kick your ass out of the tower, if I hear you snoring.”</p>

<p class="western">Johnson adjusted his hat, that shocking pink fedora complementing his Tuesday fit. One night. Just one night and he would have gone. Nothing bad. No real consequences. He stared at the shark, as he had started crying like a baby, with a dumb sense of happiness on his face, the adrenaline fading, his muscles relaxing, a weak “thank you” as the only thing he was managing to say. Johnson grunted with a mix of embarrassment and displeasure, as the burly sea creature started moving out of the door, almost crawling towards the corridor in a state of bliss, confusion and relief.</p>

<p class="western">Just one night, just one night with that bizarre freak as a guest. He shut the door of his room, locked it from inside, twice, then lay down on the dusty mattress, without even taking off his suit, slowly massaging his still aching eyebrow.</p>

<p class="western" align="JUSTIFY">
  <span>Whatever the future held for him, he hoped that finned disaster never crossed his path ever again.</span>
